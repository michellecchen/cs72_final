Firing employees, even they perform good, is not unordinary. Sony is losing market share and they are trying to survive by cost-cutting. Sony Turkey is also being smaller. (When I started, there were approximately 90 employees. After 6 or 7 months, there were around 65 employees.) Sony Turkey works on a project basis. They have a unit for each project. When the project finish, they are closing the unit. Then they may fire you or may suggest another role if exists. (Sony Turkey cannot get new projects, Sony India is getting new projects because of Indian's lower cost employee advantage. ) I worked with a bad manager. She may be one of the worst managers that I worked in the last 11 years. She did not know the technology well. When there is a problem, she even could not understand the reason for the problem. She says just do this, do that; like a typical boss but she just says the obvious and simple tasks. When there is complexity, you could not get help and feedback from your manager.

No need to stay and work late, unless your boss is working late too. Show your dedication to work, stay on doing nothing for no overtime. Oh, and if you have a car, be prepared to be told they have no space in the lot (all reserved for the bigwigs) and wont take responsibility for any muck-ups that may happen on premises. Free Lunch! Oily, unhealthy, tasteless food, dirty pantry and lack of choice. Great way to stay in touch with your Doctor. If you don't want it, no problem! Ask them to not give you lunch and bump up your salary in lieu of, and let us all know if you succeed. Multicultural environment! Yes, among the sea of Indians and Filipinos, you may spot the odd Arab or Pakistani, except ofcourse for the HODs who are mostly all Japanese and don't socialise much. Also, employees love spending time at work to cater to everyone's religious festivals; I mean why not? You're expected to stay on late anyway, might as well dance around and put on a couple of skits. Employee Engagement at the cost of a family life or time at the gym, you'd be stuck in traffic anyway, yay! Career Progression! Haven't received an education above a bachelors from an unheard of university? Haven't stayed up to date and relevant in your chosen field? Cant get ahead anywhere else? Got 5 years to spare to move up? Come on over! Employee discount! Learn about the tiny margins and then jump through hoops and red-tape; this comes naturally if you're used to working in the failing government entities or 'developing nations'. Be grateful you're getting anything at all! Simple! Yes, no need to use your experience, education, wits or industry know-how, just do what they tell you to do and no need for any inputs. I mean hey, surely these guys are still number one for a reason right? They haven't slipped at all in terms of product, R&D, marketing at all right? Right? Long term vision! The Heads keep rotating every 3-4 years and so are only concerned with their immediate results, who cares about long term goals or presence? That's a great strategy, let's keep everyone as happy as possible for now, let the other guys figure out the issues when they crop up, I certainly won't be around. Pay and benefits! Haven't you heard? They're the best! You'll get the lowdown when you join and learn about the Compa-ratio.

The only TV at the cafeteria wont play Cricket matches. ! such things will irritate you. You can see cost cutting everywhere. Evening snacks timings are 6.30-6.35pm. Yes, they last 5 mins only. LOL * Once you leave the company, and try to contact the HR for your final settlement, They will not respond untill you drop them 5-10 mails. Once it happened to me that I didnt get my notice period's last months salary. But my other frens who were serving the notice period did get it for full 2 months, every month. Further, The variable pay is not prorated for the employee who is leaving the organisation. Another cost cutting. This shows the way that payroll people are doing their job. ! * Leaving process at sisc will leave you frustrated at the company. Even if your project work is completed and it doesnt require for you to serve 2 months of notice period. They wont relieve you before 2 months whatsoever. Even if the employee has some personal problems to deal with, they wont leave you. Because its a matter of billing for them. They dnt care about staff's personal views and plans. A Complete waste of time. What you get after working 2 years is complete despair and disappointment. * SISC is a Billing Machine. It works like this. Recruit any kind of guy. Charge the innocent clients for them. Pay very less to your staff and keep all the money in your pocket. ! New people will come after seeing sony's brand name . So, they are not short of applications any time. ! * Appraisal process is amazing here. ! Yeah, its really is. The manager who meets you not even once a month, and who is heading a team of 40 people does your appraisal. Manager doesnt know the amount and quality of work you have done, he doesnt knw what issues you have encountered and you have solved. Further, You are not involved in your managers appraisal. There is no kind of feedback loop whatsoever. * For a fresher, there is a service agreement for 2 years.
