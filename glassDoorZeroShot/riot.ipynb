It is small scale, we shifted away from being a China Publishing Office to become and build the first International Studio 2 years ago. If you like to work in a Start-up environment where we need to find out things on our way, this will be the right environment for you. We slowly start to improve on/work on processes and prepare to scale for the future. This transition is interesting, as that also means a mindset change for the long term HK Rioters who are used to a certain way of working. From the surface it can look like more control and process to get the same thing done, but is is more about being deliberate about what and why we do stuff as it is easy to fall into habits we created before without thinking about whether it is the right thing to do. Being here more than 3 years feels on the one hand shorter as going to work is still a fresh experience with many new faces and working on our studio mission. On the other hand it feels longer as we have gone through quite some big strategic changes over the years. So if you like to work in a start up environment this is the right place for you. Pro of working at the Hong Kong Studio is the autonomy and space given as we are still small scale. If you are ambitious and know what and how is the right thing to do for Riot, you will flourish here. If you are someone who needs more guidance and told what and how to do something, you will be better off in a bigger office. Autonomy and space also lies in making decisions, which can be small but also big. Where I was used to making decisions before, I always still presented my decision to my MD for final approval or blessing. At Riot you really own your own decisions and you won't get the comfort of a manager blessing your decision. If you screw up, you face the consequences directly and need to solve this. This sounds bad, but is not really in real life, you will learn a lot how to make the right judgement call and how to trust your own judgement. And if you judge wrongly, you surely will learn quickly as you will need to clean up your own mess. If you like direct feedback, you are at the right place here. We are not shy providing direct feedback and this is something we are proud of and put efforts in maintaining this culture.\", 'We are still partly dependent on the Central product teams at the moment wrt the products we are working on in Hong Kong. We are part of Central, so much time and effort is put into alignment about what is the right thing to do. We are still building our muscles, so some products we work(ed) on might not be the most exciting ones. So if you have big ambitions (e.g. building our own game from the HK Studio) and want to realize these fast (like this year), this might be the wrong place for you at the moment. A much heard of complaint internally is the lack of hunger. Something I believe we should solve. I do see some teams being hungry and set themselves ambitious goals, but that is not for every team. I think where we can improve on is to hold each other more accountable for things we commit to, this will also help in the hunger issue we face. Riot takes very good care of the Rioters, but this sometimes leads to Rioters feeling entitled and not appreciative of the things we do have in place.', '5 people found this review helpful'], [\"Not the place as It's advertised.\", 'Feb 9, 2018 - Anonymous Employee in Istanbul', '3', \"- Continuous development opportunities for products. - Total given trust at what you're doing in almost all departments. - Equipment and technical needs are not a problem. - International shadowing opportunities.\", '- Senior management tends to hire people as Rioters fast that are not even gamers or tries to recruit within the company just cause they urgently need someone to fill the position as they have other plans in mind, which literally leads to a corruption of values. - Management to employee communication is so bad that, by just telling needs and asking for requests is seen as a communication. - You\\'ll be asked to wear one hat but will be manipulated into performing for three. - Career opportunities are blocked by managers and only been advertised in the company when there is an urgent need for it. - Mobbing in forms of re-positioning without asking or talking, being isolated from projects on purpose without reason nor consent, asking for overworking, not listening nor caring about serious complaints, chitchatting in an unprofessional way are real and condoned by upper management. - So called Riot values are simply not valued nor believed in the company, you can feel alone just by trying to live by them. - \"Being agile\" and Rioter code is being abused as a tool for justification of things that are wrong from the beginning. - Work/Life balance is a joke.', '7 people found this review helpful'], ['Not for everyone.....', 'Feb 2, 2018 - Anonymous Employee in Hong Kong', '5', 'Lots has changed since the Hong Kong office launched - we were first a Publishing office supporting the Chinese players, but recently switched strategy to become Riots first development studio outside of the US.

I have now been with Riot for 6 months and I am thrilled, amazed and relieved to be part of a company that wholeheartedly practices what it preaches. Riot views its Talent (aka Rioters) as its number 1 resource. Aside from the benefits like unlimited holidays, flexible hours, top of the market health plan, free snacks/fruit etc..... for me, it is the empowerment/ownership that Riot offers which demonstrates the true value that is put on staff. You are hired as an expert in your respective discipline, and treated as such. Bizarrely, in today's market this is a rarity (from my experience). A talent focused culture creates an environment where people will go the extra mile, not because their boss is telling them to, but because they are incredibly passionate about what they are doing, and embrace the opportunity to transfer their passion to our players. By ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to hiring new talent, and never dropping the bar for the sake of a 'quick fix', an environment has been nurtured where everyone is pulling in the same direction, with the same goal of improving the player experience for everyone that comes into contact with Riot or a Rioter.\", \"* Riot is not for everyone - a culture of true empowerment is extremely satisfying for some, but can be very daunting for others.

The excitement mixed with moments of cringe-worthy awkwardness? It usually lasts a couple of months – sometimes as long as six months – but eventually the new-car smell fades and you get nice and comfy in your new job. That doesn't happen at Riot. I've been here for a whisker short of a year and it never slows down. I would be the first to admit that I've drunk the kool-aid, but it tastes delicious. For me personally, working at Riot is my dream job. I have always been a gamer and to work for a company I admire has been amazing. That said; you should really be sure Riot is the place for you by researching the culture as much as you can. It's laid back but all about high-performance. You'll be asked to live outside of your comfort zone and have no one pushing you to do well, rather you will be given the trust to want to excel. If you wait for someone to tell you to do something around here then you are doing it wrong. The Oceania branch of Riot is also a little different to the rest of the world. We're a smaller team and looking to grow, so while you have access to all the resources of the mother-ship in North America, there are countless situations where you'll be wearing lots of different hats and improvising to get things done. It's very startup-esque here. We are always trying to get things done without the benefit of big sprawling teams. Personally I love that, as it makes us able to be flexible and we can make things happen, but that kind of environment isn't everyone's cup of tea. The perks are also pretty crazy, but if that's the reason you're coming on board then I would do some soul-searching first. The writing on the wall about trying to become the most player-focused company around isn't just a slogan – we live it. The culture here is much like a sporting team, everyone is mates with one another, but it's also about putting the runs on the board. As an example, this is the first place I have ever worked where there are so many high performers in the room that it can be a struggle just to keep up. This should excite you into wanting to level up and be a part of that. I have learnt more working at Riot in less than a year than I did in 3 years at my previous role.

Most of the decisions that need to made here in the Hong Kong and Shanghai office are in scenarios that a lot of companies have never experienced before: such as keeping the no title policy in the company IN CHINA. With less experienced candidates, you do get a chance to be the product owner of things, and how you want to proceed with that PO status is completely up to yourself.

Most of these functions have moved to Shanghai and the Hong Kong office pivoted into a development studio since early this year. We are around 25-ish now, half of the team are engineers. I am just updating new pros and new cons ———Building a studio from scratch ——— I love building stuff, teams, projects, etc.. If you also consider yourself more of an entrepreneur, helping building the studio in Hong Kong will be a blast. You don’t join a mold nor a machinery you need to adapt to, you build and craft it with your colleagues. ——— Big impact projects ——— Even though the studio is new, we are working on stuff that have pretty big impact and reach over a 100m players. The two bigger projects right now in the Hong Kong studio: we have two teams working on our new platform client (billions of hours are spent in it every month), and one team working on our personalisation efforts (skins). ——— Small team size ——— It is cool to know everybody in the office. When I visit the LA studio these days, I don’t know most people I run into. Here in HK office, I know everybody, that’s pretty cool. ——— Multi Cultural office ——— We have people from all over the world: US, China, Taiwan, UK, Australia, etc… we even have two french guys :-) ——— Hong Kong as a place to Live - Pros ——— The great thing about living in Hong Kong; convenient and practical city, easy commute, easy travel in Asia, affordable cost of living (food, entertainment, travel), great healthcare, top international schools, great for expats, low taxes, etc…', '——— Still a lot of muscles to build ——— While we are a very strong engineering team, other disciplines are just starting to be built. We only have a couple of artists, still no QA department, etc… This means heavy reliance on external vendors and a lot of time on recruiting and building teams. If you are a leader who hope to have a team ready for you to execute, this is not your place. Riot will expect you to come and build your team. ——— International Recruiting ——— Most of our recruiting is international (meaning out of Hong Kong). That’s cool for the diversity, but that makes the team building and recruiting efforts more difficult and cumbersome (time zone difference, jet lag, etc….) ——— Becoming multi studio organisation ——— While some other companies are expert at managing projects from multiple studios, this is really new for us at Riot. We don’t have all the great systems, process, relationships in place yet and our studio is kind of the first to try, especially at that distance. Again, great if you have entrepreneur mindset and like setting things up, but you will be disappointed if you just want to get directions and hit the road running at full speed day one. ——— Hong Kong as a place to Live - Cons ——— Now, the least exciting things about Hong Kong: Some stuff are crazy expensive (real estate, imported goods, international schools), pretty hot and humid most of the year, pollution can be bad (but much more manageable than mainland china)', '2 people found this review helpful'], ['Riot Games is a great place to work if you have good self management and a passion for what you do.', 'May 12, 2014 - Anonymous Employee', '5', \"Truly invigorating environment that lets you really contribute.

When I first walked in we were in a temporary office, there were a handful of employees and I was shown to a desk without a keyboard and told to figure it out. That was my onboarding experience. Truth be told I loved it, I was put in a situation where I had to crawl outside my comfort zone and try to figure things out. Riot OCE has gotten better at onboarding since then, there's a multi-day program in an amazing office, games with the team and a new starter BBQ. That said I loved being put in a situation where it was 'here's your desk, go figure it out'. Other places I have worked it has always been about here's what you are supposed to be doing, now go do it. Riot has always been about what do you think? What is your take on this? How can we make this better? It was exciting when I started and it hasn't gone away. Everywhere else I have ever worked I go through a couple of months of 'new job honeymoon' where everything is exciting and time flies. Then I start to hit the 3-4 month zone and you usually have your role figured out - after 6 months you have it on lockdown and that's when I wouldn't be really challenging anymore and work starts to get procedural. That never happens here. The things you work on and the role you have with the company grows as you do. If you want to kick down doors and take on more responsibility you will be given the chance to do so. I would caution to say that if you're looking for a place where you can just be a number on a team then it's not going to work out - it's very much a high performance culture. In terms of what's changed from two years ago? I would say that I have grown a lot here. I've never been challenged in a constructive way like I have been here. The team is incredibly smart, driven and united on the purpose of us being here. The mission is not just a corporate slogan on the wall, it's the driving force of every decision we make. It's pretty common to be in a meeting and people collaborate on trying to understand exactly what the best player experience for a particular project means. It can be exhilarating if you are passionate about gaming, if you're not you will find it a challenge. I still walk across the Pyrmont bridge going 'wow I get to work at Riot games today'. There's also perks like free food (breakfast on Tues/Thurs, Lunch on Weds), half price gym, free healthcare, great office space, travel, swag, etc, but to me they are icing on the cake. The best review on the perks and the talent (HR) team here is the company will always support you in whatever you are trying to do - you really do get taken care of well. But IMO the best reason to work here is the empowerment and trust. Your manager won't be micromanaging you and telling you how to do your work, you'll help shape the goals for your role and then you will own how to go out there and deliver on them. Office culture here is a big thing too. Everyone knows each other because we are a tight-knit team, it's also very welcoming to new people and so far everyone that has started here has gotten on with everyone really well. There are a lot of social events, Riot organised as well as just put together by people at work. It's pretty common for someone organising anything from a trip to the cricket to a board games night or drinks at the pub to email the whole office or walk the floor asking who is up for it. There is no private little groups here like I experienced at other companies. Everyone gets invited to everything basically and whether you go or not is up to you.

When we say we aspire to be the most player focused games company in the world, we mean it. Riot doesn't always get it right, and sometimes they can do some really silly things (hahaha replays/sandbox mode etc. As many Rioters are players themselves, they want these features as much as any other LoL player). But the heart is always in the right place and it shines through when we consider any major decision that will affect the Oceanic Player Base. We currently have a ~25 person office. Everyone is on pretty good terms with everyone else. I mean, we're all gamers, we all play League (well, almost everyone) and we all share the same mission to deliver player value. We hold internal tournaments, have catered breakfasts twice a week and a catered lunch once a week.

This is accounting for a full career in leadership and management roles spanning 20+ years, 10 of which have been in the games industry working for the most recognized names in gaming. Every place I have worked has had a set of \"core values\", but only 2 of them have ever really shown some belief in those values (Riot being one of them), and only Riot has fully nailed them from aspiration to execution, while truly living those values through their actions, extending to (and especially in) the \"customer service\" side of the business. Below are some bullets of the things that make Riot the top of the list for me: Ethos/Culture - What you do proves what you believe. The Riot Manifesto isn\\'t just some catchy words or phrases that a group of execs put together to communicate what they aspire to be as an organization. It isn\\'t pasted around the office on brightly colored posters pontificating how you should behave to be a Rioter. The Manifesto and it\\'s guiding principles are the foundation of every action, decision, and endeavor that Riot undertakes. Each individual is able to articulate how their contribution impacts the player experience, and while the recruitment process is brutal (more on that later), it is designed to identify those that share a deep connection with and belief in those principles. Empowerment/Trust - At Riot, you can make mistakes as long as you don\\'t repeat them, and as long as you are learning in the process. I have never in my career in leadership and management roles been so completely empowered. There are no strings attached, and I know that as long as I am accountable and responsible while demonstrating a strong, guided reason for my decisions, I can do pretty much anything. That isn\\'t an exaggeration ... I am trusted to make decisions that impact Riot as a whole, and that trust is as common at Riot as grains of sand on a beach. Intellectual Stimulation - I am working with some of the most intelligent people I have ever met, hands down. And I don\\'t mean just smart ... these people are next level. Riot\\'s philosophy on hiring extreme talent with shared ethos and passion has resulted in a work space that is continuously stimulating with healthy, engaging debate, conversation, and work. The bar here is exceptionally high, and because of that you are constantly meeting new people that continue to raise your expectation of what amazing is. Also, I might add, without the pretentious bullsh*t. Passion/Engagement - Riot cares, and the people do to. That is because everyone shares that common ethos and a passion, not just for League of Legends and gaming in general, but for achieving excellence and mastery. And if excellence has been achieved, they celebrate it ... then raise the bar again. It is an endless quest for perfection in a group of people that love what they do. Imagine that for a moment, and what it is like to work with those people every day. Personal/Professional Growth Opportunities - Leveling up is an integral part of being a Rioter. As I mentioned before, there is an endless quest for mastery and Riot supports this at every turn. There is a constant stream of educational and development opportunities through a variety of channels, and if there is something unique that you want to do that will help level up both you and Riot (even sometimes not directly related to your current role), there is support for that as well. As an example, I recently wanted to take an academic accreditation in a specific methodology for leadership, management, and communications. From start to finish, the approval for this took a day despite the fact that there was a cost associated with it ... that should tell you something about how Riot operates and looks at professional growth. No one has to tell me that the expectation is that I will take what I learn, bring it to Riot, and level up the other Rioters around me by sharing this knowledge. And damned right I will.', 'Recruitment Process - The recruitment process can be incredibly brutal. There can be long delays in communication before and after screenings and interviews, and the overall process is lengthy as well due to the number of people in various locations involved in every new hire process. They are working on making this process better, but it is still quite painful for many applicants. Ambiguity - Riot doesn\\'t really do black and white. If you are looking for a data and process driven work environment with people telling you what to do and when to do it, you probably wont fit the majority of roles at Riot. Riot uses data to inform decisions, yes, but context is king. You don\\'t get to lay back and say \"well the numbers say x so y is correct\". You have to figure out a lot of things, and in some cases this is great ... in other cases, it is a sign of missing direction or leadership and this is something that Riot is beginning to tackle, though it is pretty rare from what I have seen. The result in these rare situations is misalignment, which in turn can cause confusion and frustration. Blistering Pace - Things are constantly changing and evolving ... some people love this, some people don\\'t. I love it and thrive in an environment that moves at a fast pace, but I know there are a lot of people out there that prefer a more consistently stable and routine work environment. Riot really is a culture of work hard, play hard. If you can\\'t keep up, chances are you will be left behind. To use an anthropological analogy, Riot is hunter friendly, not farmer friendly. Cost of Living - Dublin, while a super cool city, is incredibly expensive in terms of cost of living. Rents are so expensive that as a sole provider in your family, things can be tight even on an above average salary, especially if you want to live in a family-friendly area around Dublin without a hellish commute to the office. That can add extra pressure if you aren\\'t prepared for this change when moving to Dublin. If you are single and going for an entry level role, chances are you will have to find a flatmate if you want to live close to work.', '18 people found this review helpful'], ['Specifics about Hong Kong Office', 'Jan 17, 2015 - Publishing in Hong Kong', '5', 'I now have been at Riot for more than 5 years. I joined few months before the game launched, traveled and helped set up multiples offices and I now work in the Hong Kong office. There are already a lot of reviews about Riot Games and I made one something like three years ago. This time, I will then focus more on the Hong Kong office, its pros and cons. ---- International accountability structure ---- in most companies, a foreign office job is to basically execute in the local country whatever the head office has decided. Or what the regional office (Asia Pacific HQ, EMEA HQ, etc..) has decided. At Riot, the structure is different. The headquarter basically decides and has authority on whatever needs to be the same everyone (like champion balance, company culture or the company logo), while the local offices decide and have authority on stuff that are specific to their territory (like local e-sports, local features, local community, etc…). What it means is that although you won’t have the authority to make a champion, a skin or change game balance from the Hong Kong office (we want the same for the whole world there, so HQ owns that), you’ll have the full accountability and authority on things that matters exclusively for China. This means: no dotted line reporting to another office, no back and forth approval over the ocean, no budget limit set by someone who doesn’t know your market, etc… If you are an entrepreneur and love action, building stuff and accountability, this is great. Your scope / impact might be more limited than in HQ (although China is a pretty big market), but you’ll have full ownership of whatever project you work on. ---- Culture---- Riot is super picky when it comes to maintaining its culture in the company. Several interviewers will interview only this area to vet during the interview process. What has been great is the company has not compromised on this when expanding into other countries. This was tricky as some of the Riot culture principles go against the local culture. As a example, the culture of performance and the principle of exiting poor performer which is unusual in some countries. Or the culture of direct and transparent feedback which is sometimes quite unusual in some asian culture. In the example of Hong Kong, Riot brought existing Rioters from different origins (America, China, Europe), but who were all Rioters for at least a couple of years. It helped ciment the culture in the office and have the new hires integrate in the culture right away. The office won’t compromise on culture fit for new hire, even if it means hiring slower than we’d want. As a result, the company culture is also transparent in the Hong Kong office. ----Office---- The office is really nice, and capture the same spirit, color scheme and comfort than HQ… with a great view as a plus! The other benefit is the location: it is based in Central, which means it is pretty accessible from anywhere in Hong Kong with massive public transportation network (buses, subway, ferry, escalators, etc…) ----Team size---- What has been great for a few of us is to work in a small team. Some of our other offices start to be big. Even if we keep an interesting team oriented org, these are still big offices where you often run into people you don’t know. At the moment, the Hong Kong office is just about 20 people. So everybody knows everybody and has good visibility on the rest of the office. ----Focus---- Because the office is focused exclusively on China, there is little distraction about all the other things that happened across the company. Several of us worked in other Riot offices for a few years and the ability to just focus on one topic is pretty cool (sure China is a big topic, but still one topic) ----Partner---- In China, League of Legends is operated by a partner. This brings pros and cons. Among the pros is this enables a lot of things. We can do stuff in China that are harder to do in other territories. Additionally, when we evaluate new projects, our partner can chip in and help with resources, and thus increase our ability to get things done.', '----Partner---- On the other hand, working with a partner means you also have to negotiate sometimes. Although we get full accountability from our HQ, we still sometimes have to negotiate with our local partner. Most of the time we are in alignment, but obviously sometimes we are not. The good news is that we are still accountable of these negotiations in our Hong Kong office. So up to us to improve the relationship or better negotiate when we think it should be improved :-). Nothing is left to fate. ----Foreign management---- One of the problem of taking existing Rioters to set up the Hong Kong office is that quite a bit of the team doesn’t speak Chinese. This limits their opportunity to interact with players, our partner and the growing number of new Rioters. On the bright side, almost all the product owners speak Chinese and the goal of the office is to have full local and chinese speaking management in the next couple of years, just like any other foreign office.', '21 people found this review helpful'], ['Great Humbitious company', 'Mar 13, 2015 -', '5', 'Really focused on their manifesto', 'Growing up company.. need to refine system and polices', '2 people found this review helpful'], ['A beautiful Lie', 'Feb 23, 2015 -', '3', 'Talented and motivated people Lots of Perks and stuff Travel travel travel Amazing development opportunities', 'Alphas too influential - in other words friendship coming on the front of hard work bad salary for lower roles ridiculous working hours: being a rioter is not a job, is a lifestyle If you want to join Riot prepare to be a RIoter and not a human being with a social life instead', '6 people found this review helpful'], ['Great place to work if you are a cultural fit', 'Jan 27, 2015 - China - Talent in Hong Kong', '5', \"Everyone believes in our core mission: We aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world.

I could go on about each of them, but several reviews already do so. Expanding on the above, a few point\\'s not called out. Entitlement: Entitlement has gone up significantly at Riot and is often found in those with the least reason to feel entitled. The number of people who waste time and have roles where they are accountable to no one has increased significantly since the start of 2015. Work quality and output that was mediocre in 2013 is now the norm. Play games 2-3 hours a day? Not a problem on some teams. Compensation: Perhaps one reason a large amount of the company feels so entitled is the pay at Riot is about 20-35% less than competitors in west LA, if you are below senior leadership level. Your ability to negotiate pay raises is extraordinarily difficult. It is seen as un-riotous to ask for more money and senior leadership often stonewalls monetary requests. What makes this so much worse than it appears at first glance is the number of senior people who are compensated very well for the work they did years ago and now coast by making so very much more than the rest of us while doing less work. Perks: Many perks which people took for granted years ago are dwindling or gone. These lost perks include: WeRiot yearly vacation, unlocked game account, equity in the company, ability to negotiate compensation packages, trips to conferences or events like PAX, and the ability to switch teams to focus on what you are passionate about are all gone or almost gone.', '38 people found this review helpful'], ['Love the cult or leave!', 'Nov 6, 2013 - Anonymous Employee', '1', 'Location in Santa Monica, vicinity to nice lunch spots, hype about the co. that turned out to be yes, just hype, and those who recruited me look like liars', 'Cultural fit seems to be more important than skills or experience.

I’m surrounded by some of the brightest people I’ve ever met, and I’m constantly being pushed off my comfort zone by the type of challenges and problems we’re solving on a daily basis. It feels like a truly unique place in Gaming created by Gamers. So, what’s so special about it? Let me try to break it down by sections. Career opportunities: Riot Games promotes open feedback culture and the notion of continuous self-development. It feels that you\\'re the sole owner of your success here due to the flat structure and how much freedom each Rioter is given. Everyone is encouraged to share their ideas, provide feedback and challenge the established notions. Though, to be fair, this is harder and harder to do due to the rapid growth of the company. Empowerment is a key word here - everyone is given the opportunity to solve problems and think creatively without being micromanaged. It\\'s very common to hear that we \"hire to elevate\" so that each new hire always pushes the bar higher, or at the very least this is the genuine intent. As a result, there are many opportunities to learn and get coaching from some of the brightest people in the industry today. The company facilitates multiple personal development resources to all Rioters (formal training, certifications, assessments, 1on1s, development plans, mentorship opportunities). Every Rioter can sign-up to a training course with the approval from a manager. And so far in my experience, this is highly encouraged. Compensation & Benefits: In my experience, the Compensation is according to the market standards. Sometimes higher, sometimes lower depending on the role and the priority that the company puts into certain areas. For example, Engineering is a high priority area for Riot, so it’s reflected in compensation. Other areas in % terms may be closer to a market standard. Of course, you can’t disconnect compensation from the cost of living. The reality, Riot Central campus is located in Santa Monica - an expensive area, so it’s something to consider when relocating from the outside. I recommend doing a thorough research on rent, transportation routes, and general expenses before committing to a decision to move. The benefits outside of salary are numerous and include standard things like private health care, dental care, eye care, free food, and snacks but also numerous not so usual benefits such as travel allowance, gaming allowance and gym subsidizing. But most importantly I feel that the company cares about me as individual and valuing my contribution and provides numerous opportunities to learn and develop my skills. To me, this is the biggest benefit of being part of Riot. Work / Life balance: Riot Games is filled with passionate people who deeply care about what they do and feel committed to delivering player value. The company’s culture is very appealing if you’re a gamer and often I found myself volunteering my time because I wanted to get something done. And I know many Rioters do the same even if the company doesn’t technically demand that special commitment from you. I believe that you own that relationship with the company 100%. After about one year with Riot, I learned how to manage my Work / Life balance better. So, in the end, I think it comes down to the individual to decide how much of that personal time you want to dedicate. Now, my line of work doesn’t demand weekend work for example. If you’re in Esports or some Live Services functions, it may not be the same. Riot is big now; multiple functions demand different work schedules, overtime, and commitments from Rioters. Senior Management: The leadership team is stacked with some of the smartest people I’ve ever met. It’s not uncommon to see legendary game industry veterans walking in the halls of the Central Campus. Now, it goes without saying that Riot isn’t free from politics, as any big organization filled with humans and not robots. That said, I think that the leadership “walks the walk” when it comes to our core values and being laser focused on our audience.', 'Growing pains: It comes without saying that not everything is sunshine and rainbows here. I know that Riot Games isn’t the company for everyone. This culture can be welcoming to many but also very hostile to some. I read some reviews that were saying this is like a boys club. And I can see where those reviewers are coming from. This is the company built by Gamers for Gamers. If you’re not part of the Gaming community, it’s likely you won’t find your place here. The explosive growth led to some pains that come with it. Our processes, tools, and practices often lack rigor or don’t scale well with a fast-paced and growing organization. This means, tons of growing pains and hard choices that we need to make. But it also means opportunities for people to adapt, change roles and expand the scope are ever more present. The hiring bar today isn’t what it was 5 or even two years ago. As a result, we have people who only experienced Riot as their first employer or took on areas that they weren’t prepared or had experience in. This led to Rioters taking on responsibilities and challenges they weren’t necessarily ready for or had an adequate support. In some cases, it worked out, but in others, it led to some painful outcomes for the organization and Rioters involved in those situations. I think we’re trying to address this and I noticed that over the last year and a half we increased our focus on hiring Industry superstars without compromising our core values. - Sarkhan Lyutfaliev', '15 people found this review helpful'], ['Great place to work', 'Aug 7, 2017 - Anonymous Employee', '5', '- Great people - Great culture - They care about your growth - They want to make things the best way - Great work environment', \"- They are bad at making a strategy - The work isn't focus - The software is not complex so there isn't a challenge on that.\", '4 people found this review helpful'], ['The Good Bad and Ugly....

Leadership is filled with privileged men who do not recognize their own privilege and destructively wield their lack of awareness. - In order to be successful at Riot you have to do one of two things: 1) deal with an absurd amount of nonsense (this is the majority of Rioters) or 2) play the political game of backstabbing, befriending the right people, and focusing on presentation rather than results or expertise. Nepotism is your friend. It is incredible how many incompetent, unproven people have risen their ways through the ranks just from smooth talking and agreeing with the people around them. - Senior leadership is the layer of cancer that infects the rest of the company. More and more \"mercenaries\" are being hired who are looking to not do much and take a lot of credit. There\\'s an obliviousness/naivety to these kinds of mercenaries from leadership (yet obvious to everyone else), and they\\'re always surprised when one leaves the company for more money somewhere else. Some have stayed long-term since they\\'ve discovered there isn\\'t a lot of hard work to be done. All they have to do is ask some \"powerful questions\" to cast the illusion that they\\'re adding value. - As progressive as Riot is in its employee policies, HR remains the same as every other company out there. They will not help you. They will only help the company. Do not bother bringing to their attention the problems you\\'ve experienced; they\\'ll just run you around conducting interviews and not actually address the issue, especially if you have a grievance towards one specific person and that person has a powerful manager. - Practicing what you preach is not followed at Riot. Leadership loves to say that it\\'s on you to call out bad people, experiences, people who are \"misaligned\", etc, but god forbid you challenge a leader when they\\'re being hypocritical or doing a bad job. Your career at Riot will end if you rock the boat, even when it\\'s clearly coming from a good place (like being player-focused). If you\\'re perceived as \"complaining\" about an issue, you\\'re done (doubly so if you\\'re a woman). Leadership is void of empathy and loves to spin everything so that you\\'re part of the problem when you bring something up. Phrases like, \"Why don\\'t you do something about it?\" \"Is this the appropriate way to bring it up?\" are thrown at Rioters when they appropriately call out red flags, ignoring the facts that they have already taken the right steps or them calling it out IS doing something because they don\\'t realistically have the power to affect it. This also relates to the privilege part I wrote out above: leadership sings about merit and disregards any real struggles people have when the odds are stacked against them. They fail to recognize that people don\\'t \"rise to the challenge\" in their eyes because they have made it a hostile, unsafe environment to do so, or that issues like sexism make it impossible for people to tackle problems. - \"Misaligned\" is a word thrown around by leadership to easily fire people, which really just translates to: \"They hurt my fragile ego and I have more power than them so I\\'ll abuse it right now.\" - Diversity is not taken seriously. There is a diversity initiative, but the truth is leadership is not empathetic of diversity and doesn\\'t fully internalize the positives of hiring minorities. They fall into the misguided attitudes of, \"More minorities should just apply\" without, again, recognizing that maybe minorities don\\'t want to for good reason. - If you\\'re a woman who is looking to succeed, you\\'re expected to act like a type-A man yet you cannot be TOO loud. The line is extremely fuzzy, so it\\'s easier to err on the side of a female \"yes man.\" It was commonplace to find that feedback included gender-based slurs for women, but not for men. - An open feedback culture is encouraged but you cannot give negative feedback to certain people or you will be shown the door. They will ignore the fact that the negative feedback you give is actually constructive and intending to improve the company, but you will be painted as a negative person yourself. It\\'s a very simple, easy defense tactic from higher-ups, and it\\'s employed frequently. Fragile egos, again. Witch hunts are common. Prepare to be called \"difficult to work with\" if you give constructive feedback to the wrong people. - It takes forever to get anything done. Trust is not widely available and there are too many stakeholders at any given point, so don\\'t expect to come out of this job with a resume with tangible deliverables. - You\\'ll be brainwashed to ignore all of these issues. If you can give into that, I envy you to a small degree.', '122 people found this review helpful'], ['Great company, culture, and perks', 'Jul 26, 2017 - Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA', '5', 'Free food, great benefits, fun work, amazing atmosphere', 'Large teams that can be a little unorganized', '3 people found this review helpful'], [\"Results don't matter\", 'Aug 30, 2017 - Development Manager in Los Angeles, CA', '1', 'Hyper intelligent and passionate people.

For seasoned professionals it\\'s a guaranteed way to take three steps back in your career. I\\'m all for a chill work space, but there\\'s a difference between understanding that jeans and cuss words don\\'t affect quality of work, and allowing people to get away with playing 35 hours of video games a week at their desks and somehow still claiming to \"add value.\" The company mantra \"default to trust\" does not mean people will respect your expertise, it means you\\'re not allowed to be offended when your insight is constantly dismissed and you are relegated to an entry-level workload despite a decade, or more, of experience. Expect many company mantras to be weaponized in this way, especially if you are a woman. Again with \"default to trust\" -- it means if you are treated unfairly or poorly, it\\'s YOUR responsibility to accept that the offender \"probably didn\\'t mean it\" instead of, I dunno, trusting that the person reporting bad behavior probably has the mental capacity to figure out whether someone \"meant it\" or not? \"Open feedback culture\" means you can only give constructive criticism that \"feels good.\" You\\'ve got to make the other person feel like a hero for accepting and overcoming whatever shortcoming you\\'re addressing. Unless, of course, that feedback is directed at something that is foundational to Riot as a company. There\\'s an imaginary line you cross when you give feedback on the culture itself. Suddenly you are no longer a culture fit -- because Riot can\\'t possibly be fostering toxic behavior. It is never Riot\\'s fault. Ever. If you don\\'t like something Riot is doing, you don\\'t \"get it\" and you are the problem. It\\'s honestly the perfect breeding ground for predators. They won\\'t fire you for this, oh no that would not fit the hip narrative pushed by the Brand team. They\\'ll just tuck you in a corner and make your life so miserable you\\'ll decide to leave yourself. Maybe they\\'ll \"strongly suggest\" that you consider whether you are \"aligned\" and that you may be successful elsewhere. You can get away with anything if you\\'re charming enough to talk your way out of it. Meritocracy? More like Mediocrity. There are SO MANY managers with NO experience managing people. Managers whose teams are floundering because they\\'re so inexperienced, they offer nothing in terms of guidance. Managers who openly admit they shouldn\\'t be managing people. And why do these people stay managers? Because they\\'re friends with the right people. Because they talk in circles. Because, honestly, at this point, firing all the useless managers would look really, really bad. I don\\'t think Riot is ignorant that they\\'ve let the most incompetent/manipulative people rise up to lead their company -- I think they realize openly admitting it would be a PR nightmare. And what would that do to the organization as a whole? HA, that was a joke. There is no organization. Your team will be reorganized every couple months. Your manager will change frequently. Sometimes your manager won\\'t even know they\\'re your manager. Sometimes you\\'ll get a random dude as a manager \"because he was bored.\" Multiple teams will be made to work on the same project and they won\\'t even realize the other exists. Titles may not have anything to do with anything you\\'re working on. Good luck getting that Director-level marketing job at your dream company when, despite multiple decades of work experience and successful campaigns, your resume is questioned because your Riot years have you listed as a mere \"media specialist\" or some other nonsense. Riot has some of the most brilliant, passionate minds trapped within its walls. Most of the people are amazing, they\\'re just stuck in a mediocre system that barely keeps itself running.

Outside of my technical duties, I\\'ve gotten involved in the community with Riot. I\\'ve had chances to attend conferences and seminars (GDC, E3, local entrepreneurship events), work on a couple internal \"level up\" initiatives, participate in collegiate events, attend hackathons, and work on some PR ideas.

There\\'s not a single meeting I\\'ve been in where an argument about player value didn\\'t trump any business argument standing against it. If it\\'s better for the player, Riot will put their money and time where their mouth is and work on it. As a gamer all my life this is a wonderful position to be in. b) Riot embraces change.

That means if ever practices are put in place that are harmful to Rioters, the players, or the business itself people are ok with owning up to it and changing it. Since change is welcomed it\\'s also more ok to fail, esp. on the art team where finding the \"better\" solution can often take weeks of work. c) Unlimited vacation days - I\\'m a hard working individual that loves to invest myself into my work, but if life happens (and it will happen) I love that Riot steps up and helps me take care of it. You need to move? Talk to your team, make sure your work is taken care off, and take time off to move. Or you\\'re struck by sickness? Go home, let it heal, come back and don\\'t get everyone else sick (yay, for not getting people sick). d) Working from home is ok.

This benefits me and other Rioters greatly as it keeps morale high and allows for some concentrated time working at home as well. e) Riot cares for us. Very decent health coverage, job stability, annual trips (at least so far), countless programs of all kinds (free lunch Tuesday, sport programs etc.)... there\\'s literally too much to do outside of work that Riot takes care off. It feels great to know that they care enough to make these things happen. f) Rioters work hard... and I would have it no other way.

No one is actively babysitting you (unlike much of the corporate world these days). Feel free to shuffle your hours around as long as you make all of your (MANY) meetings, which in practice puts a damper on that flexibility. Better stay a couple hours late, so you have time to actually do the work we talked about in all those meetings. Your work can touch a massive audience That is, if it's in the 5-10% of things we do that actually see the light of day. Most projects are a complete mess and get rebooted constantly. It's demoralizing when players complain about needing feature or product X that we've been working on for years, but will probably never ship due to internal politics. Some Riot time might look good on a resume because of our reach, but don't plan on Riot being good for your portfolio, or your confidence. Play League of Legends at work You should, because you'll need some kind of stress relief from the insanity, if you can squeeze a game in between meetings. Again, super cool benefit but kind of hampered by the reality of Riot life. The other double-edged sword is that people get really loud when they play. If your work schedule doesn't match up to your neighbors' prepare for constant distraction as they shout profanities at each other across the room. Lots of free food Remember the freshman 15? Try the Riot 20! This is how Riot shows it's love. Catered meetings and presentations, late night dinner subsidies, adult beverages at company wide events. It's really nice for the first few months. The numerous college-aged kids at Riot get excited about it a lot longer, but it's appeal can only last so long. Benefits This is one of the few areas where Riot shines. Primarily because it is easy to throw a chunk of money at the people team and there's not a lot of politics involved. If your SO doesn't have their own coverage, Riot will subsidize them as if they are an employee, which is a very nice gesture and is probably very useful to some Rioters. 401k match is decent too.\", \"Ineffective leadership Titles don't matter, except when they do. What passes for autonomy here is a lot of theoretical talk about possible directions we can go among the masses at Riot, but the actual decisions are all still made in closed door meetings between product owners and top leaders. Once teams observe this effect, they tend to flail around trying to please the leadership. There's a real sense that no one at the top really understands which of our early decisions caused our success and which were the decisions we succeeded in spite of, so many of our leaders are afraid to make the kind of bold decisions we need to raise quality to where we want it. Painful conversations often just get kicked down the road, so we trudge on with the status quo. Many mid to upper level managers are inexperienced and/or insensitive, causing pockets of poor morale and patterns of avoidance. Our values often ring false One example: we use that word humbitious (ambitious but humble). Honestly, I think we are starting to fail at both. There's a lack of urgency in the decision making progress, because it feels like we automatically rake in a fortune no matter what we do, so why rock the boat? The humble part is fading too. There are a lot of alpha types that dominate conversations and leave little room for healthy debate. Nobody is really keeping these people in check, and they are found in many leadership positions. We're overly focused on hiring over internal promotion The discipline leaders are so focused on desperately hiring as fast as possible, that they aren't nurturing their existing teams properly. If you are currently being wooed by Riot recruiters, enjoy it. It's possibly the last time you will feel like Riot really cares about your growth. There is no clear path to promotion, and it's rare to hear about them. We recently started a regular performance review program, but the reviews don't appear to have any relationship to compensation or title. Stagnant compensation If you join up you'd better darn well negotiate like a boss, because you're getting stuck with that salary for the long haul. Riot is so obsessed with hiring, that it is ignoring the stagnant compensation of it's existing teams. This a growing powder keg that few are talking about except in frustrated whispers, because leadership has made it clear that we should just do our work out of a passion for our players. It seems the managers below them have interpreted that literally to mean no one should talk about money. Ever. Sure, passion is our primary motivation, but passion only stretches so far when you never get cost of living adjustments or bonuses to prop up dead wages and the office is located in Santa Monica, one of the most expensive areas to live in So.

The issue with this is that all good things come to an end and if you can't make a new product then having the studio in one of the most expensive areas in the United States starts to be a big problem.

Otherwise expect to drive 2-3 hours into work. I've had on multiple occasions been told by junior artists that changing the workflow was too hard and they where fine with working slowly. Even if that meant a massive increase dev cost or even worse their co-workers had to work more because of it. The mid management seems to be the biggest issue there. I've seen managers actively fire people who they thought that person was a threat to their job or go out of their to manage them out. This happens regularly to higher end employees, I'd suspect because of intimidation. Promoting people who should not be in high level roles seems to be the normal, especially on the RnD teams. Artists that claim others work get promoted to leads while actually good strong devs who knows what they are doing are forced out because frankly there is a large amount of people who don't realize that game development is a job.

These hires may assimilate just fine.

Many internal systems are still those of a much smaller company and are groaning under the load. From the “emailpocalypse” of 2012 when many emails were lost to the fact that there’s no longer a room that fits everybody for our “all hands” meetings, this is a company that needs to trade up to big boy underpants.

There are some seriously gifted people here who work very hard, and it's frankly inspiring. The company does a very good job at letting those who seek it tackle greater responsibility. Player focused is not just a mantra; there are often heated debates about what that means, but it's very rare to encounter anyone who is apathetic to player concerns. They are usually shown the door very quickly. The culture has been maintained despite scaling up. In publishing in particular, the team is very strong. We've generally done an excellent job at hiring both experienced people with a passion for knowledge sharing and people just starting their careers but with a high aptitude for learning and execution. Despite the game now approaching 5 years of age, the product still has tons of opportunity for marketers and community managers to re-imagine how we do things and go bigger. The IP is super fun, the game is compelling, and the fans, of which you have unparalleled access to, are the best in gaming. There's other perks: very competitive salary, free dinners, classes, great equipment, playing games at work, but at the end of the day, the best part about working at Riot is that you'll be working with great people and you'll be rewarded if you're willing to take risks.\", 'One fact you need to understand should you happen to work in the publishing group and potentially any other group in the company: this is a production driven company. Producers, Product Owners, and Project Managers are the deciders. This in itself is not a con, as it\\'s one of the reasons Riot has been so successful, but like any organizational structure, it presents some issues. Good producers have a great impact, but inept ones are very frustrating to deal with and have a disproportionate amount of power. When a producer and someone from publishing are able to get along, to understand and listen to each other, and to make decisions together, Riot is unmatched in our ability to deliver product experiences that players love. This is often the case, but unfortunately it\\'s not always. There are two major challenges to working in a production driven environment: Release dates for features are constantly in flux. The added struggle for someone in publishing is that it\\'s not just a \"when it\\'s done\" attitude (which is a good attitude to have), it\\'s that as soon as it\\'s done, producers want to ship immediately. And since the various feature teams don\\'t coordinate their releases, you\\'ll have situations where a period of time will go by with no content, and then all of a sudden you have to make a stack rank of feature promotion and some things will just not get the attention they should. There\\'s rarely a desire for production to ever wait once it\\'s \"ready\", and because of that, players miss out. Missed opportunities come from SOME (not the majority) producers, mostly at the associate level, that either don\\'t know the expertise of the publishing group, or don\\'t see the value in marketing or community. Their are a lot of meetings or talks that these producers will set up that at first appear like they are interested in what publishing thinks about a feature, when really they just want to hear themselves talk and have publishing act as \"yes men\".

Here\\'s I\\'ll just list a few to help you determine whether Riot Games is right for you. When I first started at Riot Games, I was like awesome, a game company. After about three months, I would ask myself \"why are they running the company this way? Don\\'t they realize people aren\\'t happy with doing it this way?\" I would bring my voice to upper management--because Riot Games prides themselves on open communication--and management would say \"We don\\'t follow conventions. We like to consider ourselves unique.\" Ok, I get it. They don\\'t want to run a \"corporate\" environment, but when the company gets to the size they are (>3000 ppl world wide) there needs to be some sort of standard and compromise for growth and communication. As time went on, I would no longer see people that I would normally see. I found out they were \"let go\", but no one could give me an explaination of why. Shaddy if you ask me. So, if you want to work here...be prepared to come in late (11AM) and stay late (past 8PM). If not, you will be considered part of the \"out crowd\". It\\'s true, Riot Games is very frat like. If you\\'re not in the \"boys club\" you\\'re not going to make it. You have to be a bro, do all the bro things, and make Riot Games your life. I don\\'t recommend working at Riot Games unless you are new to the corporate world, meaning you don\\'t have any prior corporate experience. Because if you do, you\\'ll be highly dissappointed and frustrated with how management works, or doesn\\'t work actually. Maybe you can join for a year, just to get them on your resume. You might survive. If you love the game, great. Don\\'t make the game your life. Continue to play the game, which is fantastic, but don\\'t make it your life.

It\\'s all about playing politics/pleasing the right people and not getting results. Mark & Brandon\\'s vision on management and culture is what got me to join the studio and it was sad that the walk was so far from the talk. Better you know what to expect and make your decision accordingly. Because Riot is a huge list of teams though, you might get lucky and end up on a team that is very much like the talk. But if you\\'re going to management you better be ready to deal with a load of ambiguous politics and be willing to follow orders without making waves. A mere disagreement with the wrong person can lead you out. Be also prepared to be pressured to bring results and be blocked by the very same people. They somehow expect you to bring results while keeping things the same or not rubbing anyone off in the change process. You were told you were hired to bring results and bring your expertise on how other companies are organized, but in truth you were brought in to fulfill an illusion and integrate in the status quo like in any other company. Your success will depend on who you make friends with and who you rub the wrong way. So if you consider the studio with a desire to improve things, have autonomy/liberty of action and no politics you might want to pass. Riot has become a place where you \"align\" or else. Different view points are not welcome. If you\\'re an introvert you might want to pass too as Riot culture promotes assertiveness and scores low on respect of different view points, thoughtfulness and collaboration. The assertive ones win the arguments, not the best idea providers nor the data gatherers. This leads to teams spinning their wheels a lot, with the worst cases being not shipping anything in years...Teams also don\\'t like to depend on each other and rather than fix their communication, they think the solution is to be totally independent from one another which emphasizes frictions. This is quite telling on the organizational issues at hand. Prepare for some pains in getting teams to communicate or work effectively with others to get things done. I would also not recommend if you\\'re a female unless you\\'re happy to take a passive role, take notes and say yes all the time. You\\'re there to be of service, not to have opinions. While the guys can disagree to the point of screaming at each other , you\\'ll be seen as negative and difficult if you fight for your ideas. Beware what people say. Though Riot promotes direct feedback, it\\'s very hard to get honest feedback from people. If you see your manager acting weird there\\'s probably some feedback they\\'re not sharing. Make sure you can trust the people you interact with if you have constructive feedback on the company, as saying anything constructive can easily be perceived as negativity. For those of you confused by the fact that I said Riot promotes fitting in but at the same time the assertive ones win, welcome to what reviewers call \"ambiguity\". You\\'ll have plenty of situations like this at Riot, making it very difficult to assess the right course of action. You\\'ll be told to give your opinions but then your managers will be annoyed because you disagreed with them. You\\'ll be told to take initiative but then your managers and others will be annoyed you didn\\'t ask permission first etc...As a manager I consider clarity to be a key part of my role in getting great performance from my teams so that didn\\'t work for me.

Finding its Way as it Matures', 'Dec 14, 2014 - Anonymous Employee', '5', 'I\\'m not sure how to break this down into a simple list of pros and cons. Everything about Riot is dual-edged and requires consistent grounding to maintain realistic perspectives. If I could summarize, Rioters are given great power. \"And with great power comes great responsibility.\" Riot believes in its cultural manifesto. Culture drives everything, but it\\'s not as simple as reading and consenting to the manifesto. Riot culture is a mirror through which Rioters reflect on whether we\\'re winning or losing both as a company and as individuals, and it requires ongoing introspection even after years of working here. Riot has lots of perks. Free meals, parties, international trips, lots of swag, relaxed work environment, flexible hours, unlimited PTO, time allotted to play games, playfund (they will pay for you to buy games), etc. Riot takes good care of its employees and strives to create a work environment that is fun and challenging. Many on the outside accidentally mistake this for culture. It isn\\'t. Culture is the set of shared values we can agree upon as being important to us and describing who we aspire to be. During the interview process, candidates are screened not only on their raw qualifications (what have they accomplished, can they perform the job function), but on whether they demonstrate clear alignment with Riot\\'s cultural values. Yearly 360-Reviews break feedback down into categories aligned with the cultural manifesto. A large portion of Riot\\'s senior leadership is focused on how to make sure Riot\\'s culture remains intact as the organization continues to grow globally. This has some interesting manifestations as it comes to hiring and career growth. - Culture is prized more than raw technical ability in a hire. A candidate may be intellectually brilliant or driven, but will not make it through if they seem to lack humility or a default orientation toward succeeding as a team versus as an individual. I have witnessed any number of amazing engineers either be passed over as a hire or leave the company because at the end of the day they valued building awesome technology more than they valued how that technology was creating better experiences for the player. This is neither a pro nor a con, but it is a reality that potential Rioters should understand and keep in mind. - Promotion and career progression are disconnected from how \"hard\" one works, who they know, or one\\'s particular work quality (unless that quality is sub-par). It\\'s mostly a function of one\\'s demonstrated ability to force-multiply; to help their team or other teams to accomplish more and to drive new ways to approaching problems. \"Senior\" individuals are not looked at as merely having greater expertise than their peers or having higher throughput. They\\'re primarily viewed as people who are able to create an environment or atmosphere that removes obstacles and makes their peers feel empowered. Thus, longevity or delivery on mere quantity of features doesn\\'t play well for advancement. - Everything is done as part of a team. Lone-wolves, no matter how brilliant, will not succeed long term. Individual contributors are not highly valued unless they are also helping to level up the rest of their peers. Individual quantity, throughput, or flashes of brilliance don\\'t really make up for failure in this regard. - Internal advancement to senior leadership is primarily achieved through challenging convention - championing some new idea or problem space - and being able to rally a team around it. Waiting for a new department to have an open leadership slot is not very effective. Most senior leaders I\\'ve observed that weren\\'t external hires were folks who identified a problem space they cared about passionately, were able to rally others around around it, and ended up proposing and creating the team/department from wholecloth. - Management will generally not tell you what to do. This is good for the type of people Riot wants to attract, not so good for those who are fundamentally task-oriented. Leaders at Riot want to clarify goals and expectations, but unless you\\'re an associate level, they don\\'t want to tell you what to do or how to do it. They generally expect that Rioters are capable of thinking for themselves and understand when to reach out to their teammates or leaders for alignment or help. But individual Rioters are expected to own this themselves and figure out what needs to be done. This can be empowering much of the time, but also frustrating when a Rioter lacks clarity and doesn\\'t understand how to seek it. Lastly, on the positive side, Riot\\'s culture of open feedback has created an environment where everything mentioned in this review (both in pros here and the cons below) can be (and are regularly) discussed openly. Riot isn\\'t a perfect organization - it\\'s made of human beings after all - but it is an organization that craves feedback and opportunities to learn how to be better all the time.', 'Same with the pros above, I don\\'t consider these purely negative, but they do present some challenges. Most of these center on how Rioters communicate effectively as the scale of the company increases. - Hiring feels SLOW. The need to maintain Riot culture in addition to finding highly qualified candidates can make it feel like you\\'re constantly searching for a unicorn. It\\'s super important to find cultural fits. But if your team needs to hire 5 people to succeed, get ready to feel like you\\'re short on resources for the next year. - Immature communication channels. Riot is gradually figuring out how to manage team interactions as the company grows across multiple offices, but this can often be painful. There is still some startup mentality where people think they can just call folks into a room/meeting and everyone will be on the same page. This can sometimes lead to a sense that you need to be \"in the room\" in order to have your opinion matter. - Too many recurring meetings. As Riot grows and it becomes harder to have casual face-to-face conversations with all stakeholders, lots of folks try to schedule meetings as a replacement. These drain the productive juices out of many participants. Be prepared to push back on any meeting invite that doesn\\'t have a set, clear agenda. They will try to take over your calendar. - Weak meeting facilitation. Riot prides itself on being a flat organization. Bosses don\\'t dominate the discussion and all Rioters are encouraged to participate. Riot tries to create a meritocratic environment for surfacing ideas in meetings, where anyone is encouraged to speak up at any time. But without strong facilitation, this often leads to people who are willing to interrupt or those whose style is to \"think out loud\" to be the majority of the voice that gets heard. This has led to an impression among many that when it comes to getting your vision across at Riot, only alpha personalities are valued. This is an unfortunate (and inaccurate) perception, but it\\'s not helped by lack of strong facilitation during meetings. Riot needs to learn stronger facilitation techniques in order to maintain meritocratic interactions without accidentally promoting a culture that values \"waiting to talk\" over listening. Be prepared to exercise patience here. - Side-effects of a strong culture of ownership. Usually this is a great thing, as it encourages teams to take responsibility for what they create end-to-end without pointing fingers when they assumed another team would handle something for them. But a side effect one will notice over time is that some teams come to believe they own an entire type of problem space for the company and can become territorial when other teams start to tread in their domain. This is something management seems sort of aware of and is gradually dealing with over time, but it can be a pain point. People who excel at inter-team collaboration and relationship building will be most effective under these circumstances. - Individual Rioters are responsible for maintaining their own work/life balance. This is a positive in principle, but I think the company could do more to arm new Rioters with some practical tools & techniques. Nobody makes you stay late or work weekends, but it\\'s very easy to fall into doing that at Riot if you don\\'t make a conscious effort to stay on top of it.', '100 people found this review helpful'], ['Worth the effort', 'Nov 4, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA', '5', \"The people and the culture are top of the line at Riot.

It\\'s also why I left.', 'Nov 21, 2017 - Anonymous Employee in Los Angeles, CA', '2', '- Nice people - Smart people - PTOs - Free snacks - Great campus - Location', '\"Player\\'s experience first / Challenge convention / Focus on talent and team / Take play seriously / Stay hungry; stay humble.\" On paper, the Riot manifesto looks amazing. But in reality, each item of the manifesto is either being interpreted in a different way, not being used at all, or weaponized. The visible implications of this are: - Rioters would prioritize their well-being over player’s experience because the sense of entitlement has never been kept in check. Many employees play 5-6 hours a day. You don’t really need to work hard to be successful (you actually don’t need to be successful at all, just average and quiet). - Nobody feels accountable for anything meaning that nobody really cares about delivering on time, or simply delivering anything at all. - Doing anything is always about finding a consensus or getting alignment, never about challenging convention. Challenging convention is actually risky at Riot because you can easily be labelled as “complicated to work with”, “pig headed” or “culturally not aligned”. If you really want to push something without getting the approval of 50 people, you better be right because if you are right, leaders will congratulate you for that, but if you are wrong, they will tell you that you should have listened and will not trust you anymore for anything. Simply put, it’s safer to keep it low or you could get blamed for that. - Since Riot only has one game for now, innovating is always a risk. You don’t want to screw up your cash cow. - Innovation is also not possible because League has so many things to do to just catch up with the competition (because the team is so slow at delivering anything). And the results are that: - Everything takes forever. - High achievers get bored and leave. - The ones who stay get frustrated and become either toxic or chronic complainers (labelled “snowflakes” internally). -Mediocrity becomes more and more the norm. All these behaviours are due to a lack of distinct direction, ownership and accountability at every level. But at the end of the day, individual contributors are not the ones to blame. It is up to the leadership to create an environment enabling every contributor to succeed in delivering value to players.', '28 people found this review helpful'], ['LOL != Fun times', 'May 4, 2016 -', '3', 'Good pay, usually good work/life balance.

In my line of work, Riot paid above average compared to some of the other companies I've worked at. Also, as long as I notified them of work going into OT, it wasn't a big problem and for a single person like me, I didn't mind grinding a few extra hours for a time and a half. (+) Perks and benefits. Riot was the first job where I had full time benefits (I'm relatively young for my industry) and they were pretty good. Not only that, but there were a lot of perks that were given to employees to boost morale: A giant salad bar every week, a kitchen stocked with snacks and breakfast food, free stuff all the time (cookies, yoga mats, a stipend for video games, etc.). We even had a townhall every other Friday where we drank beer and watched presentations about new stuff for League and checked in on all areas of the company. Beer selection was good, too. (+) Enthusiastic employees. Pretty much everybody I worked with or knew in the company was excited to be there. Hell, I was too. Most people have a familiarity with the game and you can tell that they genuinely enjoy working at the company. (+) Office Equipment. I liked the computers and equipment I got to work with. Anything I needed for a particular project, I could send a request to IT and get it relatively soon. I had the best tech for my job and I was happy with it. (+) CEOs. Marc and Brandon, in my personal experiences with them, were very personable and down to earth. Even with the company growing exponentially, they knew what I was working on and seemed to take a genuine interest in my success. I never felt any of it was contrived. Although I can't say I worked with them directly on a lot of things (just small projects here and there), so my opinion is for the most part personal and not professional. (+) Interesting work projects. I mean, working at a video game company. It was really, really cool. I was doing something my friends were envious of and I actually liked what I was working on. Not a lot of people can genuinely say that.\", '(-) Office Location. At first, I thought it wouldn\\'t be a big problem. But, as I got bogged down in work and the hours got longer, I was getting home at 8:30 PM on AVERAGE, which even for a young person like myself, was too much. You pretty much want to live in the general area of Santa Monica where Riot is if you want to have a more reasonable work/life balance. Coming from the east side of LA, it was just insane and the commute just took the wind out of me. Now, you might say, \"Well, that\\'s on you, not Riot\" and you\\'d be absolutely correct. However, the company\\'s location pretty much provides two options for an employee: 1.) You live close to the LAX office, which is extremely costly in terms of housing and some of the cheaper areas in the vicinity of Santa Monica might not be places where you\\'d like to live, especially with a family. 2.) Deal with a crummy commute to/from work living further out. Just be prepared for an hour plus commute if you\\'re anywhere above or below the 405 or past downtown on the I-10. The 10 in the morning is just ridiculous. (-) Work/Life Balance. This started out okay, but as my department got busier and busier and made additional hires for an increasing number of projects, it slowly got a little out of control. As I said before, Riot has a lot of great/talented people and I enjoyed working with them, but I enjoy a life outside of work as well. They had a number of groups and company field trips which were fun, but I don\\'t want to live at my work. It got to the point where a lot of my friends outside of work were concerned about the amount of time I was spending at work and it didn\\'t slow down the entire time I was there. Sure, I got OT and plenty of it, but sometimes you need a rest, and having to work twelve days in a row is a bit much. By the end of it, I was just burnt out and I didn\\'t want to see the office at all. (-) Narcissism/Lack of Hubris. Another poster already mentioned the embarrassing St. Patrick\\'s Day event of 2012, but I agree wholeheartedly with him about it. The company trip to Vegas was outlandish as well. I remember walking through the penthouse of the Palms Hotel watching everybody go wild like it was college. It just seemed to reinforce this false sense of invincibility some in the company seemed to have due to the meteoric rise of League. I was wondering how Riot wasn\\'t just hemorraging money left and right with all the things they were doing for employees, professional players, business ventures, etc. All the lavish expenditures by Riot reminded me of the 30 for 30 documentary on ESPN, \"Broke\", where professional athletes detailed how they spent/wasted their fortunes and advised viewers how this \"invincibility\" you feel won\\'t last once the money stops coming in. Hopefully for them, they realize it sooner than later. (-) Confusing management hierarchy. I come from an industry where I might have multiple bosses, but I work with a relatively small number of people that report to one or two supervisors. Riot had a more corporate structure, which was to be expected, but I felt so much of what I did was being reviewed or questioned by those who had nothing to do with my department. So much unnecessary bureaucracy. No, Financal executive, I don\\'t really care for your opinion on my work, as you lack the expertise to give me an informed opinion. Also, their opinions shouldn\\'t factor in my performance reviews for the same reasons and yet they did because of this nonsense. I know Riot was hiring at a massive rate in 2012, but don\\'t give employees authority that interferes with my work simply for the reason that they need something to do. That\\'s ridiculous and inefficient. So many times I would read an e-mail giving an opinion where I just think, \"Who is this person and why should I care what they have to say?\" (-) Issues with the game. While Riot has hired the best and brightest, there\\'s so many problems the game still has even after 3+ years of its release. Still no replay system on the live client, still having major problems with server downtime, releasing champions that just absurdly better than older champions, forcing the player into \"buying power\" because they simply cannot grind the IP to compete with people who can. Unacceptable for a game that wants to be the banner game of E-Sports. The thing is, Riot is on top right now and popular. But, without a sense of direction for the game (to make it have more replay value and not get stale) and a reckless spending of money, it will go downhill very fast unless they change course.', '23 people found this review helpful'], ['Great Place To Work - If You Fit', 'Jul 9, 2015 - Associate Software Engineer in Los Angeles, CA', '4', \"Riot is an incredible place to work - you are surrounded by smart, passionate people who deeply care about the experience of players and who share an ambitious vision of making gaming better for gamers. Engineering really is trying to push game technology to the next level, and that is an incredibly rewarding challenge. Micromanaging is not really a thing at Riot - teams have the liberty to decide on how to meet their goals and are generally free to choose their own path. If you can handle the ambiguity that comes from having a goal without an externally-imposed instruction set, this is incredibly empowering. If you can't, you will fail. Benefits are pretty darn good - both in the form of standard benefits (health insurance, 401k matching, etc) and in the form of less standard perks (the new office occasionally feels like nerd Disneyland). The space we work in now is incredible, and the people who work to make sure we have a great place to work probably deserve even more praise than I can give them. The problems we work on are incredibly fun - the scale we need to support and the expected level of quality we need to hit mean that you have to stay on your toes and keep growing. If you are the kind of person who loves to rise to a challenge, and finds difficult problems their own reward, you will love this. If you aren't, Riot isn't for you.\", \"Ear Flicks: * Riot is very loud, which can be disruptive to work. * Meeting culture can be kinda lax, which is annoying if you are not lax yourself. * Living in Los Angeles More Substantive Cons: * Riot is most certainly not for everyone - you have to be incredibly comfortable with ambiguity, capable of self-management, and able to handle your own growth. You will have management, but they will be hands-off. If you can handle that, you will succeed, but if you can't, you will fail. * There isn't enough middle-management to go around. Managers are overtaxed and have too many reports, which means that individuals own even more of their own careers than was perhaps intended. * Inter-group (particularly between teams and initiatives) trust seems low at times, which is weird, given that trust is one of the cornerstones of Riot's values. * Things get done slowly - not from lack of hard work or proper prioritization, but because the core technology we work with was not built to sustain the level or kind of use it actually has. Scaling out to support the massive number of players we need to support at the level we want to support them at makes even simple problems into hard problems. Efforts to pay down tech-debt and improve our base scalability continue to improve our iteration speed, but lots of work remains. This can be really disheartening, because players often feel that we aren't working hard enough, aren't working well enough, or just don't care about them, which is as far from the truth as you can get. For me, personally, nothing hurts more than feeling like the people we do this for aren't getting what they want. * Pay isn't great - it isn't horrible, but if Riot really wants to recruit Google level talent, we need to shell out Google level money - and we don't. Most of that is probably the inherent lower pay that people in the games industry receive, but that shouldn't be a constraint we accept. * You own your own work-life balance. That sounds like a pro, but for lots of Rioters, that just enables them to have terrible work-life balance and not correct it. Teams and management need to do a better job of setting the expectation of reasonable balance. * Living in Los Angeles... No, but seriously - LA is expensive as heck to live in and has infrastructure that seems like it hasn't improved since the 1950's.

Here are excerpts from existing reviews that resonate with my experience: “Riot hasn\\'t done a great job scaling, and a lot of how it does business comes from tribal customs and values from when the company was a lot smaller. Some of these values get skewed and weaponized in unsavory ways.” “If you strive for efficiency, this isn’t the place for you. If you get stuck on one of these \"wasted\" projects, you will be pretty miserable.” “Leadership is often inexperienced and ineffective. Most senior leaders surround themselves with yes-men only and challenging the wrong leader can effectively end your career at Riot.” “Definitely the worst experiences of my career.

It\\'s hard to gauge how detrimental these factors are, because many Rioters seem happy (or comfortable) with how things are.

Lots of perks. Early in my stay it was an incredibly energetic workplace filled with passionate people who just wanted to create kickass content.', \"Teams became bloated. Still, content output dwindled as the 'horizontal' culture rested at odds with the unchecked growth. What's left is the worst of both worlds -- any of the massive number of employees can grind production to a halt if they're loud enough, so you get huge teams working in bubbles -- distant enough to make maintaining visibility a serious issue, but oversized enough to make decision making a nightmare. The word 'initiative' is the most abused in Riot's vocabulary. Responsibility and recognition are not earned by being great at what you do, it's earned by loudly championing -something- whether it comes to fruition or not. Lots of politics, bureaucracy, and red tape. Important teams were having their bandwidth squandered by the aforementioned initiative owners all insisting their cause is worth working on. Lots of playing it safe content-wise. Unique ideas get pressed into molds so they can instead be grouped and bundled up according to the (coincidentally subjective) interpretation of 'data'. This is further complicated by Riot being a global company, making it very difficult to take risks. This one's personal, but unlimited PTO actually made it feel pretty bad taking time off. You don't accumulate it, so there's no real feeling of spending it and taking a break that you've verifiably earned. This made maintaining a healthy work-life balance a challenge for me. Because leadership and management responsibilities are essentially given out to whomever asks for them the loudest, career guidance was a problem. Getting any straight answers about how to progress and level up was remarkably difficult when I was actually stuck. Hilariously masturbatory company-or-team-wide e-mails and speeches about humility. Low investment in long-term growth or product health from an engineering/tools perspective (This probably isn't news). It seems that there's always some shiny new feature or initiative being chased instead.

Downtown Culver City or the Palms are also great options if you STILL want to be close to \"things to do\", without paying high rents, but if you don\\'t mind a roomate or two, Santa Monica is a great place to live. Work / Life Balance: As the company has had explosive growth, sometimes people feel as though it is difficult to maintain work / life balance. Sometimes people complain about \"mandatory events\", but even our mandatory events have always been optional and usually come with a cool reward. For example, after our last \"mandatory\" event, we got to see The Dark Knight Rises a day before general release for free...pretty awesome if I DO say so myself ;). The people that tend to feel this way, In reality though, are those people are those who do not raise visibility that they feel inundated with work. How do I know? I used to be one of them :). As you grow at Riot, your manager WILL give you more responsibility. However, he or she will ALSO be very receptive to your needs. If you say that your workload is getting to high, managers are always willing to help and find additional resources to assist. I feel like a lot of people give Riot harsh reviews because this is their first job in the industry and don\\'t know what to expect or don\\'t know how to say no. Trust me...I worked at startups where the norm was > 90 hours / week. At Riot, I manage to still be a top performer and I honestly only work 50 hours on average per week. Granted...that\\'s not 9-5, but it isn\\'t a sweat shop either as some people have said. I would say about 2 days / month, I am at the office late because of a deploy or because there may be that occasional live issue. If you currently work here and you have done all of the above and STILL feel inundated...consider reading \"On Managing Yourself\" from the Harvard Business Review. It worked wonders for me ;). Communication: As the company has grown and new departments have formed, effective communication to ALL relevant parties has become more of a challenge. I joined when we had about 150 Rioters and it was much easier to keep everyone in the loop. Usually a quick chat with your manager can give you a clue as to who you should be including in your communication with other departments. Sometimes with regional offices around the world, you can feel the slightest tinge of a game of \"telephone\" where a message gets lost in translation. This IS something we have been working to improve though. Having worked with our international offices and almost every department @ Riot, I do feel this more than some people. I\\'ve found that it comes down to deciding in advance what is the most effective form of communication for the audience. Sometimes a meeting is the most effective, sometimes a powerpoint, sometimes an email. Sometimes it is a mixture of all three :). On-boarding / Training: Again...as we grew explosively, we are just NOW getting around to putting together many of our training programs. When I started about 2 years ago, it was very much a \"throw you in the deep end with cement shoes on\" mentality. People would be around if you started to \"drown\", but you usually were expected to grow organically by asking the right questions. Now that we\\'re getting bigger, we have gotten more effective at on-boarding new Rioters in their respective departments and also in understanding our core values. Our mentoring structure has improved dramatically and on-boarding programs have become quite effective. We still have a ways to go...but we\\'re definitely on the right track. Tech Debt: As with any company that grew at our rate, we have a decent amount of tech debt that we are now working through. We\\'re getting better and our automated test coverage is constantly increasing, but we still have a long way to go. If you do join, I guarantee there will be at least one code base you despise working in, BUT...the great part? If you really don\\'t like it, I guarantee you can find a team willing to take the time to rewrite it with you. Over the past two years, I\\'ve seen us steadily start paying back our technical debt that accrued during start up stages and the \"despised code bases\" are definitely on a decline. Not for Everyone: If you are used to a top-down organization or you don\\'t like games, you probably won\\'t enjoy Riot. We are hard core gamers and we lead bottom-up.

I don’t feel like a round peg getting pushed into a square hole. Not only am I empowered and encouraged to be myself, being at Riot has help mature me into the best version of me. There is an incredible group of peers and leadership that care so much about my growth, that they’re willing to invest hours upon hours in my professional development. This isn’t unique to just my experience - Rioters care so earnestly about leveling one another up, the growth is exponential. - Autonomy and entrepreneurial spirit: Rioters are expected to write their own story. It’s up to us to define what our path is, and Riot provides the environment where we can make that happen. Autonomy doesn’t mean going rogue or bulldozing your own ideas - they still require stakeholder vetting and buy-in. What this means is we’re in an environment where we’re encouraged to pursue big ideas, and find ways to make them real, but as a team. Managers also won’t hold your hand and tell you what to do. Riot is constantly working in ambiguity - if you need an ultra regimented or structured environment, Riot’s not for you. - Culture: This is what makes Riot special. Riot has such a firm sense of who we are, and who we’re not. The Riot Manifesto is real inside our walls, and there are stories for each one. It’s also a crucible - our limits get put to the test, and it can be really tough if you’re not prepared to handle it. - People: Rioters are the most passionate people I’ve ever met - it’s practically contagious. Most Rioters are interested in working as teams to achieve awesome stuff, and are not interested in drama or nasty-politicking. - Work/life balance: I used to be in the camp that felt that Rioter work/life balance was really bad, and that Riot needs to step in to manage/coach us better at this. Over the past year I had a lot of personal obligations come up that required me to take time off, sometimes at inconvenient times. I was able to make every wedding and family function last year (and they all required travel). Why was I able to? Because Riot’s unlimited PTO, flexible schedules, and results oriented environment allowed me to make the call if I can get my stuff done in order to commit to these personal obligations. It’s true that Rioters spend a lot of time at work, but we’re also responsible for finding the sustainable balance that’s right for us. We shouldn’t rely on Riot to coach us on how to adopt sustainable behaviors as professionals.', '- Leadership gaps: Our hiring philosophy tends to favor hiring those with growth for potential over raw talent. This has worked for us, but we now are dealing with major leadership gaps in critical parts of the org. There are bottom heavy teams, where junior managers are managing over 20 reports (seriously). Even though Riot’s identified this weakness and have prioritized hiring leaders in these key roles, there’s lots of chaos between managers, and teams are severely undermanaged as a result until we’re able to find and put those senior leaders in place. - Bro culture is real: This comes up a lot in other reviews because it’s true. I perceive that we have a higher male to female ratio compared to previous game/tech companies I’ve worked at in the past, but it doesn’t seem to discourage bro culture at Riot. Default gender pronouns tend to be “he”, jokes among team members can be inappropriate, women more often expected to take on administrative responsibilities (even amongst male peers). More recently these behaviors have surfaced as areas we have to improve, and there are groups inside Riot to be change agents - it’s far from being a toxic environment, but is a major weak area that needs to improve sooner than later. - Professionalism: Maybe this is a sign that I’m a curmudgeon, but Rioters are rowdy...and sometimes not in a fun way. More junior Rioters run the gamut of unprofessional behaviors: consistently late to meetings (or not responding to invites), inconsistent follow up/through, being super loud in open workspace (especially while playing games), leaving common areas like conference rooms super messy...and it doesn’t end there. I don’t think Rioters do this to be intentionally discourteous, but it’s super frustrating nonetheless. - Noise and distraction: It’s just loud. Our open floorplan + bad noise management in the building makes concentration at your desk nearly impossible. I rely on working from home more often in order to get work done - I would normally opt to find a phone booth room to sequester myself in, but with the shortage of conference room space at our current HQ, it’s just easier to stay at home. I hope that this is resolved in our new space /crossesfingers - Communication: We just super suck at this, across the board. Teams get spun up and down constantly and many individuals possess tribal knowledge and don’t pass them on to others. There are lots of situations where you find out two teams are working on the same problem, but in different ways, all because they don’t know to talk to one another. We really need to identify how to connect teams locally and globally to one another. - Feedback: Riot’s a feedback oriented culture, except Rioters are terrible at giving feedback. It’s common these days for Rioters to assume feedback means it’s critical in nature. There are many junior Rioters that were surprised to discover that there is such a thing as positive feedback. This exists because you have a ton of uncoached people giving feedback in a number of ways, many of which can be either untactful or just plain unhelpful. Riot claims to be good at this, but we’re not. Instead of just saying, “give feedback to this person”, we need to coach Rioters on the ways to best give and receive it. - Culture misfits: I’ve detected a number of Rioters in influential positions who feel like culture misfits - those who are seeking to engage in ugly politics and glad-handing. I worry that because of their senior roles they will poison their groups, but go undetected because of their effectiveness at managing up. Long term this is especially worrisome because the larger Riot is, the more likely the subculture goes undetected.', '22 people found this review helpful'], ['Passionate Employees Carry Leadership on their Backs', 'May 3, 2015 - Product Manager in Santa Monica, CA', '1', \"Lots of incredibly talented specialists who are fun to work with on a team.

My favorite part about working here is the autonomy you get. Other people at the company trust that you know your stuff and won't micromanage or question everything that you do. You are judged by your results (and people will judge them!). This trust is a result of an admittedly grueling interview process in most disciplines that tries to ensure that you are player-focused (you'll use your autonomy to make the right thing for the players) and that you are a master of your discipline (you'll use your autonomy to make things the right way). Another aspect of Riot that I love is how open to feedback individuals are and the company as a whole. Candid feedback is encouraged, solicited, common and responded to. A recent test of this was when there was a change in payroll that was announced ahead of time, elicited a ton of negative feedback and was promptly cancelled because of the feedback. Every company I have ever worked for in the past would have not even asked ahead of time, let alone changed their minds. Finally, it is just amazing to be surrounded by the quality of people here at Riot. Not only is everyone brilliant, they are generally humble and willing to help with anything.\", 'Riot is definitely experiencing growing pains with a dearth of strong leadership in many areas.

With the massive growth Riot has experienced, opportunities to grow and take on new challenges abound. Although the number of these open spaces is rapidly declining as the company begins to match it's growth curve, leadership does a good job of encouraging individuals to step into opportunities and problem spaces in front of them. In adopting the open PTO policy, Riot decided to put the onus of taking vacations on the employees - which can actually make it tougher to take a longer vacation when you don't see a number associated with your 'earned' days off. It does, however, make it very easy to keep illnesses at home and prevent wide-spread sickness.\", 'Riot is extremely young.

Additionally, the lack of workforce veterans has caused issues with inexperienced management not properly setting expectations, resulting in decreased performance and, at worst, attrition. The last issue is work/life balance. Although the company has established an open PTO policy, frequently many Rioters will spend most of their waking time at work. This creates a sense of missing out for those unable to spend as may hours in the office, and is ultimately unhealthy. Lastly, the culture around being gamers and curious problem solvers is a huge boon to the company, but the other side of the office culture can quite the opposite.

I\\'ve learned more at Riot than I ever thought possible, and I see no sign of that stopping. Everyone is incredibly enthusiastic about League of Legends, and that genuine passion is infectious. Culture: Almost everything about Riot I\\'d describe as \"high energy,\" dialed up to eleven. The culture is hugely focused on self-improvement and iteration. \"Challenge convention\" is a common phrase. Riot underlines how incredibly important understanding the player\\'s perspective is, so we\\'re always playing the game and trying to think globally. Open communication and seeking alignment is encouraged. Perks: So many perks... There is endless free food. Catered lunches happen frequently, and there\\'s always leftover sandwiches, pizzas, greek food, etc. IT is always stocked with candy. The beverage machine is only 25 cents a drink. There are show-and-tells and other company meetings with free beer multiple times per month. There\\'s birthday cake for everyone at the end of every month. To offset the incredible availability of free calories, there are dozens of sports and exercise groups that meet up after work... fencing, kickboxing, soccer, dodge-ball, boot-camp, you name it. The gym near the office is also subsidized to $25 a month (Though we\\'ll be moving offices in the next year or so). There\\'s a yearly company trip, all expenses paid, that generally also allows significant others along. Oh, also, you have \"discretionary\" time off, so as long as you don\\'t go crazy, your vacation days are up to you. Baller. Work-life balance: Honestly, pretty good. I know many people who work late or sometimes come in on the weekends, but it\\'s by no means expected or required. I leave around 7 PM every day and try to never come in on the weekends. That said, to learn and grow at the rate the company expects, I do sometimes feel that I need to use my free time to study and learn new techniques. Outlook: Every year the company is topping itself... the quality of talent coming in is staggering. The game is continuing to grow in popularity, with the eSports scene going from low-production-value streams with a few thousand viewers to record-shattering productions at the Staples Center in the space of two years. When we go on a yearly company trip, it\\'s Las Vegas one year, Dominican Republic the next. I\\'m going to try to hold on as long as I can. TL;DR - The only constant at Riot is change. It\\'s continually evolving and, so far, usually in the right direction.', \"Compensation/ Promotions - While my experience has been mostly positive, I know some who have had negative experiences. I'm a fairly young developer - I got into the company early, and was able to grow and get a few promotions along the way. I still have some opportunities ahead of me if I work hard, and overall I feel well-served. That said, I also have some more senior friends who feel the opportunities are lacking. I know some who took demotions or paycuts when they joined Riot. I know some who are still in that position after being at the company for years, or who feel they don't see eye-to-eye with their managers on what their compensation should be. Some departments have a reputation of having more stingy managers than others. On top of that, there is no bonus structure similar to many other game companies. Your mileage may vary. Development Uncertainty - Everything is in a constant state of change at Riot, which means that teams form and are dissolved constantly. Resources are shuffled around, and sometimes that awesome tool that was going to take a year to make gets cancelled six months in. Sometimes a team changes the game code and then dissolves when you need to ask them how it works. (To be fair on this last point: it is very much known as an issue by management and the engineering discipline is working hard to improve code ownership) In summary, while constantly changing allows us to be really agile, there's definitely some pain associated with constantly re-calibrating.\", '5 people found this review helpful'], ['embracing change - a company for the entrepreneurial spirited', 'May 8, 2014 - Senior Animator in Santa Monica, CA', '5', 'I\\'ve been with the company close to 5 years all the way from them being a less than 40 people company up to now more than 1,000 Rioters and while I had multiple (lucrative) offers to leave this is the right place for me to be at. There are a lot of things I just love about this company: a) Riot puts players first. There\\'s not a single meeting I\\'ve been in where an argument about player value didn\\'t trump any business argument standing against it. If it\\'s better for the player, Riot will put their money and time where their mouth is and work on it. As a gamer all my life this is a wonderful position to be in. b) Riot embraces change. Growing from 40 to over 1,000 people doesn\\'t come without it\\'s share of issues to solve. That means if ever practices are put in place that are harmful to Rioters, the players, or the business itself people are ok with owning up to it and changing it. Since change is welcomed it\\'s also more ok to fail, esp. on the art team where finding the \"better\" solution can often take weeks of work. c) Unlimited vacation days - I\\'m a hard working individual that loves to invest myself into my work, but if life happens (and it will happen) I love that Riot steps up and helps me take care of it. You need to move? Talk to your team, make sure your work is taken care off, and take time off to move. Or you\\'re struck by sickness? Go home, let it heal, come back and don\\'t get everyone else sick (yay, for not getting people sick). d) Working from home is ok. Since I have a lot of interaction with other artists I need to be in the office a lot, but in general it\\'s ok to take 1 day out of 2 weeks and work from home. This benefits me and other Rioters greatly as it keeps morale high and allows for some concentrated time working at home as well. e) Riot cares for us. Very decent health coverage, job stability, annual trips (at least so far), countless programs of all kinds (free lunch Tuesday, sport programs etc.)... there\\'s literally too much to do outside of work that Riot takes care off. It feels great to know that they care enough to make these things happen. f) Rioters work hard... and I would have it no other way. I don\\'t want to be a pencil pusher that clocks in at 9am and can\\'t wait for 5pm to hit. Rioters work hard, they love to play games and laugh, and they love to create awesome stuff... There\\'s a healthy balance (since we are a live game and can\\'t crunch - at least on the art side) of hard work and going home. g) There\\'s a lot of different initiatives I started since I\\'ve been at this company and the fact that Riot embraces this entrepreneurial spirit is awesome. I get bored to do the same thing over and over again for year after year. I need challenges... and with over 70 million players there are lot of challenges and opportunities. Time and again I\\'ve suggested or witnessed sometimes crazy ideas and time and again I\\'ve seen them being embraced. \"Let\\'s try it out\" and \"well, if you want to spin that up, why don\\'t you?\" are common phrases around here... and as long as that\\'s the case I will never get bored around here. Overall, I can highly recommend this company.

I'm hoping for a bus system that reaches further regions like Orange County and Valencia to help with that, but for now I have to commute a lot - Riot has too much awesome stuff going on - and believe me, you'll feel left out here and there. It's a good problem to have, though, but know that you can't do all self-improvement classes that are offered. - forgetting top down structures you've might have learned from other companies.

You will commonly see folks work 10+ hours a day, that's primarily due to their inability to utilize their time effectively. Lack of standards >> Riot is almost adverse to standards at work.

There are some seriously gifted people here who work very hard, and it's frankly inspiring. The company does a very good job at letting those who seek it tackle greater responsibility. Player focused is not just a mantra; there are often heated debates about what that means, but it's very rare to encounter anyone who is apathetic to player concerns. They are usually shown the door very quickly. The culture has been maintained despite scaling up. In publishing in particular, the team is very strong. We've generally done an excellent job at hiring both experienced people with a passion for knowledge sharing and people just starting their careers but with a high aptitude for learning and execution. Despite the game now approaching 5 years of age, the product still has tons of opportunity for marketers and community managers to re-imagine how we do things and go bigger. The IP is super fun, the game is compelling, and the fans, of which you have unparalleled access to, are the best in gaming. There's other perks: very competitive salary, free dinners, classes, great equipment, playing games at work, but at the end of the day, the best part about working at Riot is that you'll be working with great people and you'll be rewarded if you're willing to take risks.\", 'One fact you need to understand should you happen to work in the publishing group and potentially any other group in the company: this is a production driven company. Producers, Product Owners, and Project Managers are the deciders. This in itself is not a con, as it\\'s one of the reasons Riot has been so successful, but like any organizational structure, it presents some issues. Good producers have a great impact, but inept ones are very frustrating to deal with and have a disproportionate amount of power. When a producer and someone from publishing are able to get along, to understand and listen to each other, and to make decisions together, Riot is unmatched in our ability to deliver product experiences that players love. This is often the case, but unfortunately it\\'s not always. There are two major challenges to working in a production driven environment: Release dates for features are constantly in flux. The added struggle for someone in publishing is that it\\'s not just a \"when it\\'s done\" attitude (which is a good attitude to have), it\\'s that as soon as it\\'s done, producers want to ship immediately. And since the various feature teams don\\'t coordinate their releases, you\\'ll have situations where a period of time will go by with no content, and then all of a sudden you have to make a stack rank of feature promotion and some things will just not get the attention they should. There\\'s rarely a desire for production to ever wait once it\\'s \"ready\", and because of that, players miss out. Missed opportunities come from SOME (not the majority) producers, mostly at the associate level, that either don\\'t know the expertise of the publishing group, or don\\'t see the value in marketing or community. Their are a lot of meetings or talks that these producers will set up that at first appear like they are interested in what publishing thinks about a feature, when really they just want to hear themselves talk and have publishing act as \"yes men\". Disagreeing in these meetings will usually be dismissed. If you are coming from a place where you are used to marketing or business development calling the shots, and you liked that sort of environment, this is not the place for you.', 'Be the first to find this review helpful'], ['Riot Games - A team of All-Stars', 'May 8, 2014 - Artist in Los Angeles, CA', '5', 'Conscious care goes to making sure Riot is PLAYER FOCUSED, and the best they can be.

Relatively straightforward questions of business direction are still unanswered to the point of crippling progress due to an inability to get out of a no-decision spiral.

This stems from the vision and passion of its founders (Marc and Brandon) and it permeates from the top to the bottom of the organization. The secret sauce that separates Riot from other game companies is that most other game companies are founded by successful game developers who become businessmen by necessity; while Riot was founded by businessmen who love games, who understand how to run a business and understand how important the right culture is to a stellar company, and have enough self-confidence to hire and trust people with expertise they do not have (like engineering and game design). [+] Culture: Openness, excellence, self-awareness, team-focus, low-to-no politics. Do the Right Thing for the Player (the right intrinsic motivation) and revenue (the extrinsic reward) will come as a consequence. [+] Player focus: Worth highlighting even though I mentioned it above. Note \"Player\" focus, not \"Customer\" focus; that is, focus on the experience for everyone in the game, whether they pay money or not. This sincere, almost maniacal, focus on our relationship with our Players is the core of Riot\\'s success. [+] Really smart people: Talented people who are dedicated to getting even better. And who are not afraid to hire people smarter than themselves. [+] Really cool people: Humble. Ethical. Collaborative. Creative. Fun. [+] Unafraid to part ways: Able to identify people who are not a good culture fit or are underperforming; working with and coaching them to help them meet the bar; but not being afraid to let them go if a path to improvement cannot be found. [+] Global reach and impact: The ambition to bring the product everywhere in the world; and the wisdom to listen and work with the differences of each culture and region we support. This is the best company I have worked for in my career, but I know we can achieve so much more and have so much more room to improve. So let\\'s move onto the \"Cons\".', 'My analogy for Riot is that it is a rocket ship on the verge of breaking free of Earth\\'s gravity well and going on to intergalactic success. The scary part is that we keep adding more and more people to the rocket ship, and the funny thing about rockets is that you need an exponential amount of fuel for each additional person. That means each new person needs to pull more than their own weight if we want to achieve escape velocity. The biggest challenge facing Riot is whether we can manage our growth to fully achieve our potential of going to outer space. But the worst case scenario is not horrible: we\\'d still be orbiting Earth, and considering how many companies blow up on the launch pad or in the low atmosphere, we will still have achieved something grand. [+] Compensation: Despite our obvious and enormous financial success, the majority of employees, new employees especially, are not sharing in the LoL bonanza. As far as I\\'m aware, there are no bonuses, profit-sharing, or additional options being granted. Riot can get away with paying slightly-above average salaries for its very young staff who are just happy to work on an amazing game at an amazing company, but as its workforce matures, they will need to create a path for them to pay for their kids\\' college tuition and secure their retirement. [+] Culture dilution: As a consequence of extreme growth (from forty or so employees in early 2008 to comfortably over a thousand in mid 2013), it is hard to know if we are maintaining our core cultural tenets with every hire. The good news is that it is on the forefront of every hiring managers\\' mind. The bad news is that sheer size makes it hard to identify people who don\\'t actually fit our culture, and makes it hard to transfer the desired culture from existing \"good\" employees to new employees before another batch arrives. [+] Maturity: In many departments, we have hired beyond the capability of the existing experienced employees to train junior employees. People are talented and full of potential, but that potential cannot be realized without reasonable oversight and mentorship. [+] Work/life balance: Riot is not just a job, it\\'s a lifestyle. This can be good if that\\'s what you\\'re looking for, but it can be bad if you differ from the norm. Part of the growing pains will be to mature into an environment that can tolerate differing levels of commitment to work hours. [+] \"Profoundly Found Elsewhere\": The opposite of \"Not Invented Here\" syndrome. Early on, Riot had to \"make do\" with the people they could hire as a startup. The ones that remain were clearly ones that could \"punch above their weight\" when hired, and have been working on one of the most successful games in the world for years. We are now able to recruit \"big names\" from elsewhere in the industry, and we put a lot of effort and creativity into wooing and recruiting them. But I feel we do not have anywhere near the same respect for, or expend as much effort or creativity to keep and reward, the people we already have. This has most recently manifested in an entire layer of leadership hired in above existing employees. [+] Inner circle: As a consequence of our rampant growth, the visiblity that upper management has of the day-to-day in the trenches and the access employees have to upper management has naturally gone down. There is now an inner circle of trusted advisors that drive the major strategic decisions of the company, and you have to be in the good graces of someone who has influence to enact high-level change at the company. Riot is still one of the most open and agile companies I\\'ve worked for, and it continues to do things to break down these barriers with smaller town-hall meetings with Marc & Brandon. But the President of the United States has a Cabinet for a reason -- he doesn\\'t have the time to listen to every citizen armchair-expert before making key decisions. This may very well be the simple consequence of scale; but I do mourn the very flat and direct hierarchy we had when the company was much smaller. [+] Cult of heroics: Riot values the ability of a single hero (or small team of heroes) to rise up to the challenge and excel the way out of a crisis. But just because we\\'re good at fighting fires does not mean we should start them or ignore them when they\\'re small. As we mature, we need to create an environment where we have heroes but no heroics -- that is, people that could step up to any emergency, but develop, plan, and work in such a way that crises do not occur. The important thing to note here is that Riot has a deep dedication to continuous improvement. I have every confidence that we will be able to address these \"Cons\" as long as we stay true to our core tenets.', '4 people found this review helpful'], ['A place to grow while making the world of online games better.', 'Aug 5, 2013 - Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA', '5', 'Growth opportunities.

Until It Wasn't\", 'Aug 6, 2013 - Anonymous Employee in Santa Monica, CA', '1', \"Esprit de corps is high, with lots of enthusiastic and hard-working co-workers. The employees are creative and intelligent, and the overall atmosphere is very pleasant... at least on the surface. The gaming industry's notorious sexism didn't seem to be in effect; female employees were treated with respect and appeared to have ample opportunity for advancement.\", '* Bait and switch employment. When I was first hired, I received a lengthy song and dance about how Riot was different than other game companies. They claimed they respected work-life balance and that, while crunch times did happen, normal employment hours averaged 40-50 hours a week. This was a flat-out lie; 80-100 hour weeks were expected. Long work hours are forgivable; deceiving people about them isn\\'t. * Poor work-life balance. Along those lines, a number of the company\\'s smaller \"perks\" disguise their desire to have you live, eat and breathe Riot all the time. They offer subsidized dinners when you work late (which is often), plan vacations and trips to the movies as part of company outings, and otherwise monopolize as much time as possible. If you\\'re young, single and devoted to work, this can be a good fit. If you\\'re in a relationship or like doing anything outside of the office, stay away. * Bad management. Management seems to have little idea about how to handle employees, and tactics shift almost day to day. What\\'s expected of you on Monday may be 180 degrees different on Tuesday, then back to the beginning on Wednesday. Meetings take up a huge portion of the work day, with little or no practical impact coming out of them. Some people seem to spend all their time preparing PowerPoint presentations about what they do instead of getting down to the business of doing it. Resources are poorly spent, and an overall lack of leadership pervades. In many cases, managers were perfectly happy to lie about employees under them rather than take responsibility for mistakes they themselves had made. * Arrogance, bordering on narcissism. Riot encourages \"go-getters\" and \"leaders,\" which often translates to people who put their own ambitions in front of the greater good. Internecine politicking is rampant, and employees are often tossed under the bus based on agendas that have nothing to do with the company\\'s business or product. There\\'s a lot of back-biting and factionalism... though less in the rank-and-file workers than in middle management and above. Riot tries to bill itself as \"anti-corporate,\" but its overall culture is corporate in the extreme. Furthermore, a general egotism pervades among all levels of employment. The company seems to feel that a hit game gives them license to treat others with contempt or dismissal, which cuts them off from a lot of potentially beneficial people and ideas. A general fraternity atmosphere occasionally turns into the actively cruel. For instance, a company party was held on St. Patrick\\'s Day 2012, featuring little people dressed up as leprechauns. The \"performers\" hid their faces behind ski masks that clearly weren\\'t a part of their costumes, to save them embarrassment and humiliation. It made for an awkward and unpleasant event, compounded by senior management\\'s seeming obliviousness to the issue. *Lack of product diversity. Everyone there loves League of Legends, and obviously the game is doing quite well. But there were no signs of trying to diversify beyond that core product, or do more than expand it as far as it can go. They\\'ll be fine as long as sales remain high, but should the market change, this company doesn\\'t appear to have a contingency plan in place.', '32 people found this review helpful'], ['The Best Company I have ever been at.', 'Jul 11, 2013 - Art Department in Santa Monica, CA', '5', '- you are trusted - you are empowered to do what you feel is best - there is no such thing as stepping on toes - every voice is respected and heard - bottom up culture, not top down - leaders serve, not rule (I am one of the leaders) - no micro managing - no glass ceilings - full of culture - high level of self awareness of everyone around you - everyone can move the needle, and when you do, people get behind it', '- young team, more leaders are needed - current leaders are often stretched thin - some of our wants out pace what we can achieve.

This company is truly dedicated to the player experience. You won't see any cheesy inspirational posters on the wall. [+] High quality game design - there are some games out there that don't offer players much of value, and that limit player progress unless the player forks out cash. Riot's business model is more player friendly, and more sustainable for both company and player. This model is fairly unique and is the real secret to the company's success because it aligns company and player interests. [+] Excellent team – Riot has done a very good job hiring excellent people. From new college grads to experienced industry vets, this is the most capable, positive, and high-performing team I’ve had the pleasure to work with in my years of work experience. [+] Spotless ethics – this company conducts business cleanly and fairly. You’ll feel this when interacting with peers internally (there’s no backstabbing and people uphold the ideals of sportsmanship) and externally. Riot only works with vendors and partners who can truly improve the player experience. [+] Fun environment – As a result of Riot’s full-time focus on creating fun for players, we try to make sure that fun’s part of the daily work environment. [+] Mission-driven - At Riot, games are srs business. It’s never “just a game” to us because we think that entertainment and playfulness are a core human need, coming in right after those other Maslovian essentials like food, shelter, and sexy time. This is a company of people dedicated to serving that need.\", '[-] Weakened culture screening – as a result of the company’s growth, there’s been some controversial weakening of hiring standards. It’s really hard for example to find core gamers who are also really great at <insert esoteric professional skill>, so the company has had to loosen some of its standards with regards to hiring people who genuinely love games and can be termed core gamers. These hires may assimilate just fine. Or they may go on to hire additional people who don’t game, thus sending us down the long, slippery slope towards becoming another <insert game company full of people who don’t play or care about games >. [-] Immature internal infrastructure – There are about three times as many Rioters today as there were two years ago. Many internal systems are still those of a much smaller company and are groaning under the load. From the “emailpocalypse” of 2012 when many emails were lost to the fact that there’s no longer a room that fits everybody for our “all hands” meetings, this is a company that needs to trade up to big boy underpants. [-] Management upgrades incomplete – The exec team is struggling to build a layer of trusted and strategically aligned managers that they can rely on to act in a way that’s consistent with their vision. This means that they occasionally micromanage, “swoop-and-poop” and display other behaviors that don’t happen in mature organizations where mid-level management is trusted, aligned, and held accountable. I’m confident this situation is evolving in the right direction, but it’s currently not where it needs to be. [-] Hot, flat, and crowded – the current offices are increasingly less hospitable to getting work done because we’ve outgrown our current space and are jamming people into an office that was never designed for this sort of seating density.

As you grow at Riot, your manager WILL give you more responsibility. However, he or she will ALSO be very receptive to your needs. If you say that your workload is getting to high, managers are always willing to help and find additional resources to assist. I feel like a lot of people give Riot harsh reviews because this is their first job in the industry and don\\'t know what to expect or don\\'t know how to say no. Trust me...I worked at startups where the norm was > 90 hours / week. At Riot, I manage to still be a top performer and I honestly only work 50 hours on average per week. Granted...that\\'s not 9-5, but it isn\\'t a sweat shop either as some people have said. I would say about 2 days / month, I am at the office late because of a deploy or because there may be that occasional live issue. If you currently work here and you have done all of the above and STILL feel inundated...consider reading \"On Managing Yourself\" from the Harvard Business Review. It worked wonders for me ;). Communication: As the company has grown and new departments have formed, effective communication to ALL relevant parties has become more of a challenge. I joined when we had about 150 Rioters and it was much easier to keep everyone in the loop. Usually a quick chat with your manager can give you a clue as to who you should be including in your communication with other departments. Sometimes with regional offices around the world, you can feel the slightest tinge of a game of \"telephone\" where a message gets lost in translation. This IS something we have been working to improve though. Having worked with our international offices and almost every department @ Riot, I do feel this more than some people. I\\'ve found that it comes down to deciding in advance what is the most effective form of communication for the audience. Sometimes a meeting is the most effective, sometimes a powerpoint, sometimes an email. Sometimes it is a mixture of all three :). On-boarding / Training: Again...as we grew explosively, we are just NOW getting around to putting together many of our training programs. When I started about 2 years ago, it was very much a \"throw you in the deep end with cement shoes on\" mentality. People would be around if you started to \"drown\", but you usually were expected to grow organically by asking the right questions. Now that we\\'re getting bigger, we have gotten more effective at on-boarding new Rioters in their respective departments and also in understanding our core values. Our mentoring structure has improved dramatically and on-boarding programs have become quite effective. We still have a ways to go...but we\\'re definitely on the right track. Tech Debt: As with any company that grew at our rate, we have a decent amount of tech debt that we are now working through. We\\'re getting better and our automated test coverage is constantly increasing, but we still have a long way to go. If you do join, I guarantee there will be at least one code base you despise working in, BUT...the great part? If you really don\\'t like it, I guarantee you can find a team willing to take the time to rewrite it with you. Over the past two years, I\\'ve seen us steadily start paying back our technical debt that accrued during start up stages and the \"despised code bases\" are definitely on a decline. Not for Everyone: If you are used to a top-down organization or you don\\'t like games, you probably won\\'t enjoy Riot. We are hard core gamers and we lead bottom-up. You\\'ll probably flounder if you don\\'t embrace that ideal or don\\'t enjoy games.

This time, I will then focus more on the Hong Kong office, its pros and cons. ---- International accountability structure ---- in most companies, a foreign office job is to basically execute in the local country whatever the head office has decided. Or what the regional office (Asia Pacific HQ, EMEA HQ, etc..) has decided. At Riot, the structure is different. The headquarter basically decides and has authority on whatever needs to be the same everyone (like champion balance, company culture or the company logo), while the local offices decide and have authority on stuff that are specific to their territory (like local e-sports, local features, local community, etc…). What it means is that although you won’t have the authority to make a champion, a skin or change game balance from the Hong Kong office (we want the same for the whole world there, so HQ owns that), you’ll have the full accountability and authority on things that matters exclusively for China. This means: no dotted line reporting to another office, no back and forth approval over the ocean, no budget limit set by someone who doesn’t know your market, etc… If you are an entrepreneur and love action, building stuff and accountability, this is great. Your scope / impact might be more limited than in HQ (although China is a pretty big market), but you’ll have full ownership of whatever project you work on. ---- Culture---- Riot is super picky when it comes to maintaining its culture in the company. Several interviewers will interview only this area to vet during the interview process. What has been great is the company has not compromised on this when expanding into other countries. This was tricky as some of the Riot culture principles go against the local culture. As a example, the culture of performance and the principle of exiting poor performer which is unusual in some countries. Or the culture of direct and transparent feedback which is sometimes quite unusual in some asian culture. In the example of Hong Kong, Riot brought existing Rioters from different origins (America, China, Europe), but who were all Rioters for at least a couple of years. It helped ciment the culture in the office and have the new hires integrate in the culture right away. The office won’t compromise on culture fit for new hire, even if it means hiring slower than we’d want. As a result, the company culture is also transparent in the Hong Kong office. ----Office---- The office is really nice, and capture the same spirit, color scheme and comfort than HQ… with a great view as a plus! The other benefit is the location: it is based in Central, which means it is pretty accessible from anywhere in Hong Kong with massive public transportation network (buses, subway, ferry, escalators, etc…) ----Team size---- What has been great for a few of us is to work in a small team. Some of our other offices start to be big. Even if we keep an interesting team oriented org, these are still big offices where you often run into people you don’t know. At the moment, the Hong Kong office is just about 20 people. So everybody knows everybody and has good visibility on the rest of the office. ----Focus---- Because the office is focused exclusively on China, there is little distraction about all the other things that happened across the company. Several of us worked in other Riot offices for a few years and the ability to just focus on one topic is pretty cool (sure China is a big topic, but still one topic) ----Partner---- In China, League of Legends is operated by a partner. This brings pros and cons. Among the pros is this enables a lot of things. We can do stuff in China that are harder to do in other territories. Additionally, when we evaluate new projects, our partner can chip in and help with resources, and thus increase our ability to get things done.', '----Partner---- On the other hand, working with a partner means you also have to negotiate sometimes. Although we get full accountability from our HQ, we still sometimes have to negotiate with our local partner. Most of the time we are in alignment, but obviously sometimes we are not. The good news is that we are still accountable of these negotiations in our Hong Kong office. So up to us to improve the relationship or better negotiate when we think it should be improved :-). Nothing is left to fate. ----Foreign management---- One of the problem of taking existing Rioters to set up the Hong Kong office is that quite a bit of the team doesn’t speak Chinese. This limits their opportunity to interact with players, our partner and the growing number of new Rioters. On the bright side, almost all the product owners speak Chinese and the goal of the office is to have full local and chinese speaking management in the next couple of years, just like any other foreign office.', '21 people found this review helpful'], ['Finance', 'Aug 5, 2015 - Anonymous Employee', '5', 'An empowering company, that has solid core values that are lived every day in every decision (to understand more look at the companies mission statement).

This is accounting for a full career in leadership and management roles spanning 20+ years, 10 of which have been in the games industry working for the most recognized names in gaming. Every place I have worked has had a set of \"core values\", but only 2 of them have ever really shown some belief in those values (Riot being one of them), and only Riot has fully nailed them from aspiration to execution, while truly living those values through their actions, extending to (and especially in) the \"customer service\" side of the business. Below are some bullets of the things that make Riot the top of the list for me: Ethos/Culture - What you do proves what you believe. The Riot Manifesto isn\\'t just some catchy words or phrases that a group of execs put together to communicate what they aspire to be as an organization. It isn\\'t pasted around the office on brightly colored posters pontificating how you should behave to be a Rioter. The Manifesto and it\\'s guiding principles are the foundation of every action, decision, and endeavor that Riot undertakes. Each individual is able to articulate how their contribution impacts the player experience, and while the recruitment process is brutal (more on that later), it is designed to identify those that share a deep connection with and belief in those principles. Empowerment/Trust - At Riot, you can make mistakes as long as you don\\'t repeat them, and as long as you are learning in the process. I have never in my career in leadership and management roles been so completely empowered. There are no strings attached, and I know that as long as I am accountable and responsible while demonstrating a strong, guided reason for my decisions, I can do pretty much anything. That isn\\'t an exaggeration ... I am trusted to make decisions that impact Riot as a whole, and that trust is as common at Riot as grains of sand on a beach. Intellectual Stimulation - I am working with some of the most intelligent people I have ever met, hands down. And I don\\'t mean just smart ... these people are next level. Riot\\'s philosophy on hiring extreme talent with shared ethos and passion has resulted in a work space that is continuously stimulating with healthy, engaging debate, conversation, and work. The bar here is exceptionally high, and because of that you are constantly meeting new people that continue to raise your expectation of what amazing is. Also, I might add, without the pretentious bullsh*t. Passion/Engagement - Riot cares, and the people do to. That is because everyone shares that common ethos and a passion, not just for League of Legends and gaming in general, but for achieving excellence and mastery. And if excellence has been achieved, they celebrate it ... then raise the bar again. It is an endless quest for perfection in a group of people that love what they do. Imagine that for a moment, and what it is like to work with those people every day. Personal/Professional Growth Opportunities - Leveling up is an integral part of being a Rioter. As I mentioned before, there is an endless quest for mastery and Riot supports this at every turn. There is a constant stream of educational and development opportunities through a variety of channels, and if there is something unique that you want to do that will help level up both you and Riot (even sometimes not directly related to your current role), there is support for that as well. As an example, I recently wanted to take an academic accreditation in a specific methodology for leadership, management, and communications. From start to finish, the approval for this took a day despite the fact that there was a cost associated with it ... that should tell you something about how Riot operates and looks at professional growth. No one has to tell me that the expectation is that I will take what I learn, bring it to Riot, and level up the other Rioters around me by sharing this knowledge. And damned right I will.', 'Recruitment Process - The recruitment process can be incredibly brutal. There can be long delays in communication before and after screenings and interviews, and the overall process is lengthy as well due to the number of people in various locations involved in every new hire process. They are working on making this process better, but it is still quite painful for many applicants. Ambiguity - Riot doesn\\'t really do black and white. If you are looking for a data and process driven work environment with people telling you what to do and when to do it, you probably wont fit the majority of roles at Riot. Riot uses data to inform decisions, yes, but context is king. You don\\'t get to lay back and say \"well the numbers say x so y is correct\". You have to figure out a lot of things, and in some cases this is great ... in other cases, it is a sign of missing direction or leadership and this is something that Riot is beginning to tackle, though it is pretty rare from what I have seen. The result in these rare situations is misalignment, which in turn can cause confusion and frustration. Blistering Pace - Things are constantly changing and evolving ... some people love this, some people don\\'t. I love it and thrive in an environment that moves at a fast pace, but I know there are a lot of people out there that prefer a more consistently stable and routine work environment. Riot really is a culture of work hard, play hard. If you can\\'t keep up, chances are you will be left behind. To use an anthropological analogy, Riot is hunter friendly, not farmer friendly. Cost of Living - Dublin, while a super cool city, is incredibly expensive in terms of cost of living. Rents are so expensive that as a sole provider in your family, things can be tight even on an above average salary, especially if you want to live in a family-friendly area around Dublin without a hellish commute to the office. That can add extra pressure if you aren\\'t prepared for this change when moving to Dublin. If you are single and going for an entry level role, chances are you will have to find a flatmate if you want to live close to work.', '18 people found this review helpful'], ['Great on surface, but there are problems underneath.', 'Dec 22, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in Dublin, Dublin', '3', \"Great benefits, good environment.

You really want to heavily avoid anything relating to the central teams or \"publishing\". - This company has incredible potential, but see the cons section below as to why it\\'s a problem', 'Riot is truly a place that struggles because it scaled too quickly and never figured out its leadership layer correctly. So, all the successes of the company are found in the part of the company that is valuable: GAMES. The current CEO, Nicolo is a good person, who ultimately cares a lot about the company and the employees, but doesn\\'t have what it takes to lead. It\\'s just a sad reality. He doesn\\'t know how to create games (he never has done this), he doesn\\'t know how to hold his publishing team accountable (he built it, it\\'s pretty much all he\\'s done in his career and so he doesn\\'t know how truly terrible it is), he doesn\\'t know how to prioritize or focus (his approach is always the biggest bets, not necessarily the smartest bets and he\\'s been unwilling to change anything materially--it sounds big at first, but it ends in status quo), he doesn\\'t know how to delegate (he holds his decisions close to himself and doesn\\'t even delegate to his leadership team). He doesn\\'t know how to set strategy (he just talks big talks about things that have nothing to do with the historic success of the company and are not even necessarily valuable moves--I\\'m being vague for Glassdoor... but basically distractions). He\\'s also not your inspiration type leader either--that\\'s ok. but he\\'s very low empathy and pretty arrogant, which makes him gaffe-prone. Under his leadership he has further eroded accountability and has not furthered \"rewards\" for \"risk\"--people internally ask themselves \"why should I bust-ass for Riot? why don\\'t I just go somewhere else to gain more upside or grow?\". Now, the truth of this is: this really mostly matters if you\\'re director level up. If you\\'re an incredible IC or Senior, that wants to make games and you\\'ve got a dream job on League, well then take it. It\\'ll make you very happy, you should get paid well, and the game teams are legitimate. It matters for directors up because you\\'re the ones who have to deal with this level of top-level incompetence. Riot refuses to get a handle on their social media and that blows up? Boom, you\\'re now stuck in 1:1 with annoyed sometimes entitled employees. You drive impact and are successful? Well, too bad: there\\'s no real growth for you, or maybe it\\'s all going to be decided behind closed doors anyway. There are no plans to have growth, no true mentorship, no skip-level investment. You only advance when someone else leaves or by luck of the constant incompetent org shuffles. Of course, if you\\'ve got a great manager you\\'re in great shape. But basically it\\'s all local, be in a great situation, you\\'re in great shape. This all feels like maybe it\\'s getting better... but it\\'s way too slow and poorly executed and just a failure of the top leadership team. They don\\'t know how to empower or raise. They\\'re mostly working hard and well meaning, but this is literally what happens when people are stretched into roles that they are not equipped to do and rise to their level of incompetence. And it\\'s hurting the company--because the great talent is leaving. The thing is there is no true top-leadership team, it\\'s just a collection of some mostly great leaders that don\\'t have empowerment, it\\'s just the Nicolo show. Here\\'s the deal: - Game teams and R&D: The true magic of Riot. These work well. - Publishing: led by a truly bad leader who doesn\\'t know what he\\'s doing; no accountability. Ridiculously over-funded to the detriment of other parts of the company that need the resources--with not much to show for it (I know, Riot can do pretty awesome marketing, but that STARTS on the game team, or succeeds despite this organization because of a few heroes) - Central Tech/Riot GO/Central Platform: Really concerning implementation of an idea that could work, but because of bad tech choices, or leadership decisions and the way they are placed is a bit of a mess. Getting better, but concerning. - HR&Finance, etc.: Both hilariously over-funded and under-funded at the same time.

Easy to find motivation if you are intrinsically motivated. - Relaxed culture, not too many places in the org where you will find hard deadlines, and even in the cases where there are there is not a lot of pressure from management or leadership. This does lead to low performers overstaying at Riot for far too long, even when they have shown their peak, and high performers not getting compensated for their value because nobody cares quite frankly. - Decent compensation, particularly for gaming. For engineers however, compensation lags greatly behind what you can get at a FAANG or other startups. Overall Riot is a safe place to work, and with that comes the good and the bad. If you are a 2x3 or 3x2 on a 9 box (which you will be graded on), you can expect to stay at Riot as long as you want at a decent compensation. Riot's games are mostly pandemic-proof and recession-proof. However, if you are a 3x3 you will be underpaid and can find better opportunities elsewhere.\", \"- After the League of Legends 10 year anniversary announcement and launching our new games, the company is struggling to find it's next big goal and that is squarely on Nicolo and the LC1 team. The MMO is good enough as a goal for now, but for some of the big picture goals that the leadership team has been saying for years, Riot is not taking the big bets required to get there because there is not a concrete vision. - Pay bands and changes to job architecture, particularly for technology/engineering, are causing many high performers to exit the company. Their compensation is effectively stuck outside of their 3% annual raise until they can get to the next band or PX+. Riot has some ways around this (cash & stay bonuses, etc.) but this has not stopped the deluge of high performers from leaving over the last 3 years, and has and will only get worse over 2021, especially after the payout in March.\", '12 people found this review helpful'], ['Great place to grow as a developer', 'Apr 15, 2021 - Art Director in Santa Monica, CA', '5', 'Knowledge sharing at its best.

I was lucky enough to have some great, supportive leaders and thanks to their support, I was well compensated, provided with challenges that enabled me to grow while also being lucky enough to do well in the Tencent purchase, though this also marked the beginning of the end for Riot with a new CEO and increased Tencent oversight. Marc and Brandon were truly inspirational founders, who gave generously back to their staff, more than was needed. The founders have not been around in recent years, though Marc is back, which is great for Riot. Riot does look after its people in many ways - the benefits (medical, life insurance, 401k match, comp is decent and bonuses can be good) and there’s a nice campus. I guess superficially also with great lunches/coffee and the kitchen pantries that many Rioters like to raid for their late-night weekend gaming snacks. There are managers who genuinely care and also provide great mentorship, but once you get to a senior leadership level, both that mentorship and the Learning Development programs for middle management (and up) are severely lacking. The games are great, well maybe not all - it’s worth calling out the creation and execution of TFT as being incredible (the protection that team got to work in a bubble was impressive, huge credit to LoL leadership and all involved).', 'The current vision and future plans are uninspiring and weak, but when you put Publishing in charge of the company you will become a stolid publisher like many game companies before. In reality, Nicolo’s vision is executed as “all the things, let’s not miss out on China and give Jin more”. There is a lack of accountability throughout, especially in Senior and Executive Leadership, which is evidenced by Publishing becoming so powerful despite being the worst-performing area of the company for years (and they defunded the teams that were supposed to measure their performance), but yet their leader just keeps getting more power. Many in leadership care more about your \"approach\" versus what you contribute. They ask for your feedback but they don’t really want it, especially if you point out \"the emperor has no clothes\". At this point, be prepared for feedback about being critical, or advised to get aligned or to stick to your lane. You may then hear a narrative about you being negative or misaligned. If you want to progress to VP and above, be prepared to be political but look, this goes for most companies so that’s just life, but it seems to have become worse since the CEO change. The executive team have empowered the vocal minority (i.e. the Slack warriors, who are bitter about everything and whose job seems to be to ensure every social issue is a focus for Riot), while also rewarding many overly political leaders, who drive mostly failure, dish the kool-aid without any substance and never have to worry about being held accountable. So, with the culture changing, reward for performance “standardized”, and unaccountable leadership who continue to be allowed to get away with anything, the best talent is now leaving (during a pandemic) - many good leaders, upper management layer (who carried the company despite the weak executive layer) and ICs (i.e. the doers). Leadership has a tough job now on their hands to ensure more talent doesn’t leave but it’s mostly of their own making. They will most likely protect themselves and tell their own narrative regarding those who have left were not a cultural fit or were negative, i.e. “don’t worry, we are stronger now”. In closing, if you’re reading this and thinking about joining Riot, it really depends on the area you’re joining and its leadership. There are many amazing and talented people there (LoL, TFT & Valorant would be the highlights, though they’ve also lost a plethora of talent) but it is a cult and be wary of the narrative. There will also probably be an exodus of talent next March when the final big bonus payment drops.', '26 people found this review helpful'], ['Vet the team you plan to join', 'Dec 3, 2020 - Anonymous Employee', '3', 'Good people, good benefits and company tries to do what is best for its employees', 'Bad management in some pockets of teams', '1 person found this review helpful'], ['Must know for interview', 'Nov 8, 2020 - CEO-Founder in Los Angeles, CA', '5', 'Friendly team and good place to work with high salaries', 'Have to be on time.

Quickest path to nowhere at Riot on most teams. - Riot can be pretty clique-y. - “Business Unit Leaders” / departmental heads battle with one another constantly and the CEO is too new and inexperienced to make calls to rectify problems. - Prepare yourself for lots of politics. - Finding anything (assets, knowledge, etc...) in the company requires Sherlock Holmes level investigative techniques. - A group of original people who started at Riot with minimal outside experience have been promoted to director/VP levels - They are pretty much immune to being fired, short of being the subject of an expose by a journalist. They are entrenched. Some of them are bullies. Some of them have no social skills. Some of them are grossly incompetent people who only surround themselves with \"yes\" people. Some of them create or have created highly toxic workplaces. \"good ol boys club\" mentality is still in full swing at Riot, even if they\\'re not sexually harassing people anymore. - Riot doesn\\'t do a great job at aligning goals from the front lines up to the CEO. There is no OKR type system, so things can get really messy and confusing. - The \"product\" and \"delivery\" disciplines are in charge of everything, yet they are the most unorganized group at the company. - HR/Talent is a dysfunctional organization. They are not your friend and they are not invested in YOU as an employee. They are purely there to reduce liability for Riot. They operate in total secrecy. They report to a department leader, not to someone in charge of HR which is an inherent conflict of interest. Don\\'t trust them. - Culturally, you will be expected to “be positive”. It reminds me a lot of Theranos or the Fyre festival. (Watch those documentaries, they\\'re good!). This comes at the expense of leaders finding out what’s really wrong with products or teams and doing things about it. Or if they know, they don\\'t care to change. The majority of the time, most concerns or problems have the feeling of being “swept under the rug”. - If a leader is at fault, problems are usually not addressed without anything short of a public outcry. This often creates a secret toxic environment you should be very aware of. A lot of leaders within Riot want \"Yes\" people, not people who challenge their thinking or raise issues.

It\\'s a sad and sobering fact that none of them are overly dramatic. This place is extremely toxic. - \"Bro culture\" and harassment run rampant and pervades leadership. You know those Uber stories going around recently? Riot is a half-step down from those experiences. Your clout and stability are directly proportional to the state of your abs (I\\'m only somewhat kidding about this). Leadership is filled with privileged men who do not recognize their own privilege and destructively wield their lack of awareness. - In order to be successful at Riot you have to do one of two things: 1) deal with an absurd amount of nonsense (this is the majority of Rioters) or 2) play the political game of backstabbing, befriending the right people, and focusing on presentation rather than results or expertise. Nepotism is your friend. It is incredible how many incompetent, unproven people have risen their ways through the ranks just from smooth talking and agreeing with the people around them. - Senior leadership is the layer of cancer that infects the rest of the company. More and more \"mercenaries\" are being hired who are looking to not do much and take a lot of credit. There\\'s an obliviousness/naivety to these kinds of mercenaries from leadership (yet obvious to everyone else), and they\\'re always surprised when one leaves the company for more money somewhere else. Some have stayed long-term since they\\'ve discovered there isn\\'t a lot of hard work to be done. All they have to do is ask some \"powerful questions\" to cast the illusion that they\\'re adding value. - As progressive as Riot is in its employee policies, HR remains the same as every other company out there. They will not help you. They will only help the company. Do not bother bringing to their attention the problems you\\'ve experienced; they\\'ll just run you around conducting interviews and not actually address the issue, especially if you have a grievance towards one specific person and that person has a powerful manager. - Practicing what you preach is not followed at Riot. Leadership loves to say that it\\'s on you to call out bad people, experiences, people who are \"misaligned\", etc, but god forbid you challenge a leader when they\\'re being hypocritical or doing a bad job. Your career at Riot will end if you rock the boat, even when it\\'s clearly coming from a good place (like being player-focused). If you\\'re perceived as \"complaining\" about an issue, you\\'re done (doubly so if you\\'re a woman). Leadership is void of empathy and loves to spin everything so that you\\'re part of the problem when you bring something up. Phrases like, \"Why don\\'t you do something about it?\" \"Is this the appropriate way to bring it up?\" are thrown at Rioters when they appropriately call out red flags, ignoring the facts that they have already taken the right steps or them calling it out IS doing something because they don\\'t realistically have the power to affect it. This also relates to the privilege part I wrote out above: leadership sings about merit and disregards any real struggles people have when the odds are stacked against them. They fail to recognize that people don\\'t \"rise to the challenge\" in their eyes because they have made it a hostile, unsafe environment to do so, or that issues like sexism make it impossible for people to tackle problems. - \"Misaligned\" is a word thrown around by leadership to easily fire people, which really just translates to: \"They hurt my fragile ego and I have more power than them so I\\'ll abuse it right now.\" - Diversity is not taken seriously. There is a diversity initiative, but the truth is leadership is not empathetic of diversity and doesn\\'t fully internalize the positives of hiring minorities. They fall into the misguided attitudes of, \"More minorities should just apply\" without, again, recognizing that maybe minorities don\\'t want to for good reason. - If you\\'re a woman who is looking to succeed, you\\'re expected to act like a type-A man yet you cannot be TOO loud. The line is extremely fuzzy, so it\\'s easier to err on the side of a female \"yes man.\" It was commonplace to find that feedback included gender-based slurs for women, but not for men. - An open feedback culture is encouraged but you cannot give negative feedback to certain people or you will be shown the door. They will ignore the fact that the negative feedback you give is actually constructive and intending to improve the company, but you will be painted as a negative person yourself. It\\'s a very simple, easy defense tactic from higher-ups, and it\\'s employed frequently. Fragile egos, again. Witch hunts are common. Prepare to be called \"difficult to work with\" if you give constructive feedback to the wrong people. - It takes forever to get anything done. Trust is not widely available and there are too many stakeholders at any given point, so don\\'t expect to come out of this job with a resume with tangible deliverables. - You\\'ll be brainwashed to ignore all of these issues.

They completely disregarded a woman who left in my dept who called sexism when she and I were both overlooked for a position that was then given to a man who had 2.5 years of experience (when we both had over 10 years of experience). They refused to answer why he was given this role when he clearly had far less experience than both she and I. They then ignored that this man then went on a power trip and would not prioritize any of my work (despite having PROOF that my efforts were in fact paying significant dividends). That man then disinvited me to meetings that I should have been apart of and made decisions about me that didn\\'t actually involve me. He wouldn\\'t respond to communications and questions from me that he knew I need to be successful in my role but he had no problem communicating with the men in the dept. He would then claim he just forgot to mention it (when it significantly would affect how I worked with the team). He forced me to work on things that they knew were outside my skill set just to get confirmation biases that I wasn\\'t good and needed help (they then admitted to me that they had done that). They labeled me \"not a big enough gamer\" even though I played more LoL than anyone in my department. They told me they were open to finding me a better role and then 3 separate times got started and then shot down the ideas. My then \"supposed manager\" took nearly 2 hours of blabbing rather than admitting I was being let go. I had to ask him why we were talking for 2 hours with no clear sign about what the conversation was about and had to ask him \"are you trying to let me go\" in which he then responded \"that is what they asked me to do\". WHO IS THEY? He wouldn\\'t answer. That man then put his arm around me and tried to coddle me as though I was a child. Being a woman does NOT make me weak and his insinuation that I needed to be hugged is outrageous. Some may misconstrue that as highly inappropriate although I know that was not his intention. Finally, Riot built up a case against me. They only talked to 3 people I rarely worked with any they knew I had contention with, rathering the speaking to the 12 people I worked most closely with to get feedback.

Unlimited growth and learning -- you are only capped by your imagination and determination. I have learned more in my craft at Riot than I could have in 15 years at my previous company. I'm so grateful for the opportunities to learn that I've been given and the hard work of my mentors. This gift is so valuable to me that I feel a duty to pass it on to others in the org. My mentors have inspired me to grow others as much as they have grown me. 2. Truly awesome co-workers, deep interpersonal bonds between Rioters, awesome culture and social environment. I treasure my friends that I've made at Riot and love working with my team. They make me laugh and look forward to coming to work. I have made deep lifelong connections at Riot that I will always cherish. 3. When Riot's culture lives up to its ideal (which it often does, at least on LoL), it feels soooo good to work there--people are rational, open-minded, Socratic, authentic, funny, kind, and competent. Collaboration can reach a crazy height of functionality at Riot. (This is not always what happens, but in my experiences it is virtually extinct at many other companies, and is the status quo in many places within Riot). 4.

Some old-boy types are poor listeners and might have pretty inflated egos at this point from being treated like gods for the several years. 3.

Its painful, and disruptive of people's lives, but ultimately best to let these people go. It's best for both them and for everyone who does earn their keep at Riot.

If one were to isolate a turning point in Riot’s culture, my money’s on the Tencent buy-out in late 2015. Company culture, which used to be flawed (as any place is) but usually good at heart has become much more “Lord of the Flies” as senior leaders are preoccupied with empire building or just completely checked out. Often you can find multiple layers of management (including the top) who have no idea what is going on and who stonewall progress because good ideas aren’t theirs. Organizational planning is more or less nonexistent which at thousands of employees means lots of redundant work and people with no real responsibility free-riding. Relatively straightforward questions of business direction are still unanswered to the point of crippling progress due to an inability to get out of a no-decision spiral. Acquisitions are poorly integrated and seem like boondoggles for our senior leaders and finance team rather than genuine ways of extending our products or reach. Leadership is unconcerned with the above and pretty content to fiddle while Rome burns, or more specifically they seem to prefer hanging out with other LA celebrities and spend their money and company resources vs. generating new business. Progress on new titles is glacial, I’ve lost track of how many times we’ve been beaten to market. The most successful use of our IP in the last seven years (honor of Kings) wasn't made by us and there has been no perspective from leadership on either why that shouldn’t have been Riot or how we’re going to meaningfully change in the future to be more successful at shipping new experiences to players. The most concerning part is the low sense of urgency even after many years of setbacks. I’ve had high-performing colleagues who have switched off of new games teams of their own volition because they were bored due to lack of work.
