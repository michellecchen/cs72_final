Great office and team , cool senior management 
Upper management in most department is fantastic ; they really try think of the team 's best interest 
The upper management in North America doe their best to foster good company culture and new idea despite what seems like a frustrating lack of room to grow for those upper executive 
Ubisoft is very informal : you could get in touch zwith a top manager without referring to all the hierachy 
They try hard , let down by a few higher ups 
Everyone from the studio GM on down is very accessible and part of the team 
Good menagement , good lead 
Senior Leadership is supportive with good ambition for successful game

Gain a lot of experience 
Young studio , good chance for entry or mid level to work your way up to senior 
There is a definite coolness factor in working at Ubisoft 
The Digital Marketing and PR team are probably the only team I would recommend to anyone , and probably Brand Management 
The PR team , while they do n't have a lot of power or sway at Ubisoft ( at least compared to other PR team I 've worked with at other gaming company ) have GREAT leader who want to grow their team -- they care about mentoring and doing a good job 
Brand is chaotic but they hold most of the power , so I would recommend it a a good starting point for someone looking to go into Brand/Marketing 
If you 're looking to get your foot in the door at a game company in an entry level role , Ubisoft is a good place to start 
Get your name on some AAA title then reevaluate once you hit the 2 year mark 
Working for a company that released some of the greatest video game 
The people are great , and working on large AAA title is very enticing and a lot of fun 
You 'll gain great experience here and it 'll impress recruiter when seeking future employment 
Lots of resource and work with game industry talent 
It 's a great place to learn about the business and gain experience all while helping make the best game in the industry 
Easy commute , good people work here 
It definitely kept me motivated to continue learning and get better at my job 
Enjoys working with graphic design and computer in general , also meeting new people is a huge one too 
Exciting time to work at Redstorm 
Able to move abroad if you are talented 
Get to experience a little bit of everything from sale to marketing 
Many creative thinker in the gaming world with annual meeting to discus the new year game Good opportunity to work with global team member and transfer to Montreal or France 
It seems like a fun place to work and most of the time it is 
Very European place to work 
In addition to having a great product and a successful history , Ubisoft also ha a great working environment 
You can even participate in the creation of world-famous game IPs 
Ubisoft give you the opportunity to grow very quickly 
Also , depending on your job description , you may have a lot of autonomy and freedom in your job 
Will gain experience while working
