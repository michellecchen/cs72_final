As many Rioters are player themselves , they want these feature a much a any other LoL player )

[LISTSEP]
Company which respects its employees and is pleasure to work at
Good company overall
 The brand and reputation make you feel a rockstar
 Feedback culture
 This transition is interesting, as that also means a mindset change for the long term HK Rioters who are used to a certain way of working
 From the surface it can look like more control and process to get the same thing done, but is is more about being deliberate about what and why we do stuff as it is easy to fall into habits we created before without thinking about whether it is the right thing to do
 Being here more than 3 years feels on the one hand shorter as going to work is still a fresh experience with many new faces and working on our studio mission
 If you are ambitious and know what and how is the right thing to do for Riot, you will flourish here
 At Riot you really own your own decisions and you won't get the comfort of a manager blessing your decision
 If you screw up, you face the consequences directly and need to solve this
 We are not shy providing direct feedback and this is something we are proud of and put efforts in maintaining this culture
 this makes for an awesome culture within the studio, offering huge opportunities to learn from one another, and is a lot of fun! One close knit team, all sharing the same mission
 People are self disciplined and self motivated 
 Staffs have high degree of autonomy, but sharing the same vision and culture helps to align people to the same direction 
 People here generally less care about position and power
 Feedback culture
 When I was invited to meet with the guys at Riot, on conducting my pre-interview research, I was delighted to read about the employee focused culture, but I also maintained a healthy portion of skepticism as so many companies talk the talk, but so few walk the walk
 I have now been with Riot for 6 months and I am thrilled, amazed and relieved to be part of a company that wholeheartedly practices what it preaches
 for me, it is the empowerment/ownership that Riot offers which demonstrates the true value that is put on staff
 A talent focused culture creates an environment where people will go the extra mile, not because their boss is telling them to, but because they are incredibly passionate about what they are doing, and embrace the opportunity to transfer their passion to our players
 By ensuring that everyone is on the same page when it comes to hiring new talent, and never dropping the bar for the sake of a 'quick fix', an environment has been nurtured where everyone is pulling in the same direction, with the same goal of improving the player experience for everyone that comes into contact with Riot or a Rioter
 It is a company that values your input and creates an open feedback culture where your views really do matter
 Riot is a very collaborative workplace where you will work across many functions and teams with the purpose of creating value for the players
 That said; you should really be sure Riot is the place for you by researching the culture as much as you can
 It's laid back but all about high-performance
 If you wait for someone to tell you to do something around here then you are doing it wrong
 The writing on the wall about trying to become the most player-focused company around isn't just a slogan – we live it
 The culture here is much like a sporting team, everyone is mates with one another, but it's also about putting the runs on the board
 This place teaches you so much about yourself and challenges you to improve and to want to grow
Riot Games is a company that values its culture a lot and puts enormous effects living up to it
 The company strategies are also communicated clearly to everyone so even there is no hierarchy, no clear internal processes and policies, rioters can make decisions indecently
I personally love this company, and like its mission statement, this company is literally one of THE most player-focused companies I have ever had the opportunity to work for
 They take this statement very serious, and you can hear the words "player focused", "default trust", and "culture fit" anytime and everywhere in the company
 When it comes to less experienced candidates, Riot somehow actually fully trusts in your judgement to make a tough call; they also embrace your mistakes, as long as you're willing to admit it
 The culture here at Riot is also one thing I love, and hate: the feedback culture is very honest and open
 If you did something that others don't agree, they will voice it out
 One more thing I'd like to mention is the policy of having no titles in the office to reduce the hierarchical ladder in China
 This gives new employees all the freedom to talk to anyone in the office about a problem or concern without having to think if they stepped over the line per se
 part of the whole business, community and experience
 this is not just some fad word thrown about by hr with little belief
 Every decision, initiative, action riot does is weighed against the value it will add to the player experience 
 this is not an office which is just an extension of US HQ where we salute and do what is told
 We trust you 
 This is not a tech company, this is a gaming company, and yes, we play games at work
Awesome culture, great people to work with, great opportunities
Direct feedback culture, trust, a real gamer company and alway focused on the highest player value!
Riot games is a company with a really strong culture and values, and that always fascinate me
 I rarely saw in a company that many people so passionate for their job and that is definitely one of the key element of Riot success
Extremely passionate team Open environment where everyone can contribute and own problems
Brilliant culture, An opportunity to work with cool people
I am kind of person who cares a lot for the purpose and meaning of my role and my interpersonal relationship at work
 The mission is clear, the culture is strong, employees share an aligned framework, and what is left for me to figure out my skills, my dedication and creativity
 Instant feedback culture
 ——— Small team size ——— It is cool to know everybody in the office
 Rioters work hard together to do cool things because they think its cool, not just because its a job
 No egos, just a bunch of people who care about the same things, and want to help Riot create good experiences for gamers
 The Hong Kong office is unique in that it is still very much an entrepreneurial atmosphere, but it has the resources to lean back on of the entire Riot
 • Our hiring standards are very strict, and results in us getting the absolute best people
 • We’re a very collaborative bunch – we’re always relying on our team mates to help provide some expertise or even just an opposing viewpoint
 • We like to experiment – sometimes it turns out good, sometimes it doesn’t, but we always get some learning out of it and you’re not faulted for failing unless you do it repeatedly without learning
I think the best way I can sum up Riot OCE is when I first started here I thought 'Why would you want to work anywhere else?' and 2 years later that hasn't changed
 Other places I have worked it has always been about here's what you are supposed to be doing, now go do it
 That never happens here
 it's very much a high performance culture
 The team is incredibly smart, driven and united on the purpose of us being here
 The mission is not just a corporate slogan on the wall, it's the driving force of every decision we make
 But IMO the best reason to work here is the empowerment and trust
 Office culture here is a big thing too
Good culture, people is easy to work with but also have a healthy culture to ask questions and challenge others Flat structure 
 Ideas are more important than people
 Staff have high degree of trust and everyone has good intention 
 Compare to previous company, staffs here trust each other in doing things with good intention
 Everyone here wants to make an impact to the gaming community
 It is ok to "fail" here
 Failure is considered to be the path to success and opportunity to learn
 High degree of freedom but everyone has the same vision and alignment to get things done 
 The culture here also aligns us to the same goal
 You are expected to be the best at what you do, that raises the bar for you and the team; 
 Open feedback (from Global Surveys to special classes that help us consolidate and grow a true open/actionable feedback culture)!
 Everyone here are players themselves, really embodying the company culture
 Riot has one of the best cultures I've ever seen in a company
Great place to work, where everybody cares and is ready to help when you need help, even if it means they need to delay their projects
 High trust in the individual to get things done 
 Riot is different from a lot of other workplaces
 If you look at the manifesto, that's not there for show, it's something we actually believe in and incorporate into our day to day activity
 When we say we aspire to be the most player focused games company in the world, we mean it
 But the heart is always in the right place and it shines through when we consider any major decision that will affect the Oceanic Player Base
 I mean, we're all gamers, we all play League (well, almost everyone) and we all share the same mission to deliver player value
 This office is full of very driven people, and it's expected that you are able to manage your own time effectively and deliver results
 Nobody's going to tell you what to do, but if you need help, there's always going to be a helping hand
 This office is very much one about open feedback
 We're expected to level each other up
 Everyone is passionate about gaming and can usually use player values as the guideline to make decisions
An empowering company, that has solid core values that are lived every day in every decision (to understand more look at the companies mission statement)
 The culture at Riot is not just talked about but it is expressed in the actions and words of all Rioters
 All Rioters are seen as leaders, and level is not a excuse to stop people leading
 Every place I have worked has had a set of "core values", but only 2 of them have ever really shown some belief in those values (Riot being one of them), and only Riot has fully nailed them from aspiration to execution, while truly living those values through their actions, extending to (and especially in) the "customer service" side of the business
 Below are some bullets of the things that make Riot the top of the list for me: Ethos/Culture 
 What you do proves what you believe
 The Riot Manifesto isn't just some catchy words or phrases that a group of execs put together to communicate what they aspire to be as an organization
 It isn't pasted around the office on brightly colored posters pontificating how you should behave to be a Rioter
 The Manifesto and it's guiding principles are the foundation of every action, decision, and endeavor that Riot undertakes
 Each individual is able to articulate how their contribution impacts the player experience, and while the recruitment process is brutal (more on that later), it is designed to identify those that share a deep connection with and belief in those principles
 At Riot, you can make mistakes as long as you don't repeat them, and as long as you are learning in the process
 There are no strings attached, and I know that as long as I am accountable and responsible while demonstrating a strong, guided reason for my decisions, I can do pretty much anything
 I am trusted to make decisions that impact Riot as a whole, and that trust is as common at Riot as grains of sand on a beach
 Riot's philosophy on hiring extreme talent with shared ethos and passion has resulted in a work space that is continuously stimulating with healthy, engaging debate, conversation, and work
 Riot cares, and the people do to
 That is because everyone shares that common ethos and a passion, not just for League of Legends and gaming in general, but for achieving excellence and mastery
 And if excellence has been achieved, they celebrate it 
 It is an endless quest for perfection in a group of people that love what they do
 The headquarter basically decides and has authority on whatever needs to be the same everyone (like champion balance, company culture or the company logo), while the local offices decide and have authority on stuff that are specific to their territory (like local e-sports, local features, local community, etc…)
 This means: no dotted line reporting to another office, no back and forth approval over the ocean, no budget limit set by someone who doesn’t know your market, etc… If you are an entrepreneur and love action, building stuff and accountability, this is great
 Culture
 Riot is super picky when it comes to maintaining its culture in the company
 What has been great is the company has not compromised on this when expanding into other countries
 This was tricky as some of the Riot culture principles go against the local culture
 As a example, the culture of performance and the principle of exiting poor performer which is unusual in some countries
 Or the culture of direct and transparent feedback which is sometimes quite unusual in some asian culture
 It helped ciment the culture in the office and have the new hires integrate in the culture right away
 The office won’t compromise on culture fit for new hire, even if it means hiring slower than we’d want
 As a result, the company culture is also transparent in the Hong Kong office
 The office is really nice, and capture the same spirit, color scheme and comfort than HQ… with a great view as a plus! The other benefit is the location: it is based in Central, which means it is pretty accessible from anywhere in Hong Kong with massive public transportation network (buses, subway, ferry, escalators, etc…) ----Team size
Really focused on their manifesto
Everyone believes in our core mission: We aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world
 It's the first company I have worked for that has every team member believe and live by the company's mission
 This is a great entrepreneurial work environment that gives people the ability to work on what they believe is right
 Giving this level of trust means that there is an expectation that you fit culturally here, and your judgement is aligned with Riot
 They are mentors and coaches who give feedback and help you align better to Riot Culture value
1) Full of brilliant, energetic, creative people 2) Every team is working on something awesome 3) Cultural benefits are great 
 Culture & Values: is a company run by gamers and we base every decision thinking "what I would want from a company in this case?" 
 Empowerment: you are encouraged to do what you think is good for the players
Company which respects its employees and is pleasure to work at
Good company overall
 The brand and reputation make you feel a rockstar

The culture here at Riot is also one thing I love , and hate : the feedback culture is very honest and open 
If you did something that others do n't agree , they will voice it out 
One more thing I 'd like to mention is the policy of having no title in the office to reduce the hierarchical ladder in China 
This give new employee all the freedom to talk to anyone in the office about a problem or concern without having to think if they stepped over the line per se 
part of the whole business , community and experience 
this is not just some fad word thrown about by hr with little belief 
this is not an office which is just an extension of US HQ where we salute and do what is told 
We trust you 
This is not a tech company , this is a gaming company , and yes , we play game at work 
Awesome culture , great people to work with , great opportunity 
Direct feedback culture , trust , a real gamer company and alway focused on the highest player value ! 
Riot game is a company with a really strong culture and value , and that always fascinate me 
I rarely saw in a company that many people so passionate for their job and that is definitely one of the key element of Riot success 
The company make an effort to keep the opportunity open for all employee for new idea and collaboration 
Extremely passionate team Open environment where everyone can contribute and own problem 
Brilliant culture , An opportunity to work with cool people 
I am kind of person who care a lot for the purpose and meaning of my role and my interpersonal relationship at work 
The mission is clear , the culture is strong , employee share an aligned framework , and what is left for me to figure out my skill , my dedication and creativity 
Instant feedback culture 
Rioters work hard together to do cool thing because they think it cool , not just because it a job 
No ego , just a bunch of people who care about the same thing , and want to help Riot create good experience for gamers 
The Hong Kong office is unique in that it is still very much an entrepreneurial atmosphere , but it ha the resource to lean back on of the entire Riot 
• We ’ re a very collaborative bunch – we ’ re always relying on our team mate to help provide some expertise or even just an opposing viewpoint 
I think the best way I can sum up Riot OCE is when I first started here I thought 'Why would you want to work anywhere else ? ' and 2 year later that ha n't changed 
Other place I have worked it ha always been about here 's what you are supposed to be doing , now go do it 
That never happens here 
it 's very much a high performance culture 
The team is incredibly smart , driven and united on the purpose of u being here 
The mission is not just a corporate slogan on the wall , it 's the driving force of every decision we make 
But IMO the best reason to work here is the empowerment and trust 
Office culture here is a big thing too 
Good culture , people is easy to work with but also have a healthy culture to ask question and challenge others Flat structure 
Ideas are more important than people 
Compare to previous company , staff here trust each other in doing thing with good intention 
Everyone here want to make an impact to the gaming community 
Failure is considered to be the path to success and opportunity to learn 
The culture here also aligns u to the same goal 
You are expected to be the best at what you do , that raise the bar for you and the team ; 
Open feedback ( from Global Surveys to special class that help u consolidate and grow a true open/actionable feedback culture ) ! 
Everyone here are player themselves , really embodying the company culture 
Riot ha one of the best culture I 've ever seen in a company 
Great place to work , where everybody care and is ready to help when you need help , even if it mean they need to delay their project 
High trust in the individual to get thing done 
If you look at the manifesto , that 's not there for show , it 's something we actually believe in and incorporate into our day to day activity 
When we say we aspire to be the most player focused game company in the world , we mean it 
But the heart is always in the right place and it shine through when we consider any major decision that will affect the Oceanic Player Base 
I mean , we 're all gamers , we all play League ( well , almost everyone ) and we all share the same mission to deliver player value 
This office is full of very driven people , and it 's expected that you are able to manage your own time effectively and deliver result 
Nobody 's going to tell you what to do , but if you need help , there 's always going to be a helping hand 
This office is very much one about open feedback 
Everyone is passionate about gaming and can usually use player value a the guideline to make decision 
Teammates are friendly yet push each other to achieve excellence 
An empowering company , that ha solid core value that are lived every day in every decision ( to understand more look at the company mission statement ) 
The culture at Riot is not just talked about but it is expressed in the action and word of all Rioters 
Every place I have worked ha had a set of `` core value '' , but only 2 of them have ever really shown some belief in those value ( Riot being one of them ) , and only Riot ha fully nailed them from aspiration to execution , while truly living those value through their action , extending to ( and especially in ) the `` customer service '' side of the business 
Below are some bullet of the thing that make Riot the top of the list for me : Ethos/Culture 
What you do prof what you believe 
The Riot Manifesto is n't just some catchy word or phrase that a group of exec put together to communicate what they aspire to be a an organization 
It is n't pasted around the office on brightly colored poster pontificating how you should behave to be a Rioter 
The Manifesto and it 's guiding principle are the foundation of every action , decision , and endeavor that Riot undertakes 
Each individual is able to articulate how their contribution impact the player experience , and while the recruitment process is brutal ( more on that later ) , it is designed to identify those that share a deep connection with and belief in those principle 
Riot 's philosophy on hiring extreme talent with shared ethos and passion ha resulted in a work space that is continuously stimulating with healthy , engaging debate , conversation , and work 
Passion/Engagement 
That is because everyone share that common ethos and a passion , not just for League of Legends and gaming in general , but for achieving excellence and mastery 
And if excellence ha been achieved , they celebrate it 
It is an endless quest for perfection in a group of people that love what they do 
The headquarter basically decides and ha authority on whatever need to be the same everyone ( like champion balance , company culture or the company logo ) , while the local office decide and have authority on stuff that are specific to their territory ( like local e-sports , local feature , local community , etc… ) 
This mean : no dotted line reporting to another office , no back and forth approval over the ocean , no budget limit set by someone who doesn ’ t know your market , etc… If you are an entrepreneur and love action , building stuff and accountability , this is great 
Culture 
Riot is super picky when it come to maintaining it culture in the company 
What ha been great is the company ha not compromised on this when expanding into other country 
This wa tricky a some of the Riot culture principle go against the local culture 
As a example , the culture of performance and the principle of exiting poor performer which is unusual in some country 
Or the culture of direct and transparent feedback which is sometimes quite unusual in some asian culture 
It helped ciment the culture in the office and have the new hire integrate in the culture right away 
The office won ’ t compromise on culture fit for new hire , even if it mean hiring slower than we ’ d want 
As a result , the company culture is also transparent in the Hong Kong office 
The office is really nice , and capture the same spirit , color scheme and comfort than HQ… with a great view a a plus ! The other benefit is the location : it is based in Central , which mean it is pretty accessible from anywhere in Hong Kong with massive public transportation network ( bus , subway , ferry , escalator , etc… ) -- -- Team size 
Really focused on their manifesto 
Everyone belief in our core mission : We aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world 
It 's the first company I have worked for that ha every team member believe and live by the company 's mission 
This is a great entrepreneurial work environment that give people the ability to work on what they believe is right 
Giving this level of trust mean that there is an expectation that you fit culturally here , and your judgement is aligned with Riot 
They are mentor and coach who give feedback and help you align better to Riot Culture value 
1 ) Full of brilliant , energetic , creative people 2 ) Every team is working on something awesome 3 ) Cultural benefit are great 
Culture & Values : is a company run by gamers and we base every decision thinking `` what I would want from a company in this case ? '' 
Empowerment : you are encouraged to do what you think is good for the player 
Sure it 's about finding the best talent , but it 's equally about making sure that everyone hired fit the company culture ? So what is culture , is it 'we all like to joke around and have fun whilst we work ' ? No , it 's the core value that Riot ha 
that our player are our first concern , that we need to do our best for them at all time , that we need to always be improving 
Being in an environment where everyone share the same value a I do is incredible 
I 'm now encouraged to follow my instinct , to push the envelope , to make mistake , try new thing , to unlock my imagination and drive any project I believe will bring our player benefit 
Riot Games is not really a standard working place : it 's more like a style of life , where love what you are doing and you get rewarded for that 
What I really liked about working there is the passion in people , their professionalism , and ability to grow in many , many direction 
The culture is great 
I know that every company ha a mission statement , some closer or le to the reality of thing but in Riot we live by our mission statement and we embrace our manifesto 
For example one of the value closer to me is `` player experience first '' and `` Take play seriously '' 
This mean that not only we love League of Legends and we like play together but also that we feel the pain of our player when something go wrong 
She wa so astonished about the people she met and the passion we put into League of Legends that she now totally get it ( also we are not divorcing nor in any kind of crisis 
It 's true , Riot doe n't mess around 
You are either a high performer & culture fit or you will not succeed in Riot 
YOu can always speak your mind without fear 
* Riot accepts no constraint 
Very gamer culture oriented and expectation are clearly laid out 
The spirit of progressive company innovation and organization is there 
The people and environment are top notch 
+ I 've worked at other company that care about it team , but never like Riot 
It 's so much in the leadership 's core to treat it team well and value u a the reason for the company 's success 
Nurturing our culture is top-of-mind for leader , without feeling like it 's just PR or corporate BS 
+ There 's a lot of trust and autonomy 
No BS 
Huge fan of gaming , the most supportive , fun and exciting group of passionate industry professional you 'll ever work with 
The culture `` bleeds '' the manifesto , when it 's working it is truly amazing , the strength of that manifesto allows even struggling team to do reasonably well 
If you follow the manifesto and have a good supportive manager , you can do very well here 
Riot celebrates those who take accountability seriously 
fun and dynamic , true to it value 
Lots of freedom to take on initiative , plenty of opportunity to solve different problem space , you can build relationship even with others not immediately within your working ladder , and the culture ha plenty of likeminded gamers who believe in the Riot Manifesto 
There are lot of pro and I feel they are subjective to each person , but to me , the biggest pro is the culture at Riot 
Previous company I 've worked for have a manifesto but do n't eat their own dog food , that is not the case at Riot and it generally put a smile on my face when decision are made based around how impacting it will be our player overall experience ( positive or negative ) and focus is adjusted in a positive direction 
The culture is what I 've always wanted 
A place where it 's cool to be a nerd and people care passionately about what they 're working on 
People do n't ask `` do you play game ? '' but instead a `` what game do you play ? '' I think it would be hard for a non-gamer to feel at home here unless you were highly competitive ( e 
BUT if you do n't like game , you might feel resentful of people doing that 
Riot is an inspiring place to be 
Leadership continues to impress me with exciting vision and a focus on player value that manages to actually feel true 
We have bi-monthly all-company meeting , and I always walk away from those feeling very proud of my place of work 
Strong culture 
Riot 's game development team are top notch both in talent and in culture 
Caring is Riot 's super power 
you can match our team up against any of the competition and I 'd bet on Rioters caring the most every single time 
-Gamer Culture 
To outsider of the gaming world , this conjures up vision of Grandma 's Boy-a bunch of dude playing video game all the time 
The actual significance is that to most Rioters gaming is n't just something they do , it 's a huge part of who they are 
More than reminiscing about old game , the shared experience connect most Rioters in a special way that directly lead to being able to empathize and make decision for our player 
-There are plenty of team and office ( not just LA ) that have n't lost the magic feeling of Old Riot by finding way to shield themselves from most of the struggle 
Company genuinely belief and try to live a player-first mentality ( even if not always successful ) 
* The culture is great if you love game because people here are passionate about game * Hire for culture and hire smart people 
Company culture 
It ha a focus on hiring gamers and always think about putting the player experience first 
`` Players first '' culture and `` one Riot 
It 's really exciting to see them LISTEN , acknowledge and put new process and mindset in place to help improve the company and prepare it for it next inflection point 
Incredibly passionate and talented coworkers and leadership Leadership care about employee True focus on our player first Empowerment to pursue your idea and personal growth 
Coworkers will be gamers who are passionate and who want to make the best experience for gamers 
Great culture where staff are empowered to deliver great thing 
Riot is hyper-focused on player , I 've never worked at a company that life up to it mission statement in every corner of the company 
Everyone belief in the mission and work towards it 
Riot is a place that try to aspire to always be better -- it 's a mindset that I resonate with and what drew me to the company 
+Feedback culture +Good people +Company perk 
The company is focused on delivering great player experience , not on how to extract money from unhappy people 
They honestly care about their player first , last , and everywhere in between 
They exemplify all of Riot 's value 
The focus on hiring people who actively play game really doe change the atmosphere of the company 
The company is obsessively player-focused 
++ Company culture ( in theory ) 
Advocates transparency , self reflection , and team work 
Impressed with Riot ’ s gamer cred overall 
-Rioters seem humble and willing to learn from their mistake 
Furthermore , I feel like I can trust my coworkers to do the right thing and be motivated to make the right decision for the player 
At it core , Riot is humble 
Clearly , mistake have been made , but when flaw or failure are identified Riot not only strives to fix them , but also hold itself highly accountable for them happening in the first place 
Steps are being taken to properly identify and remove bad actor , a well a ensure that every person here understands how to be their best self and how to combat wrongdoing 
I have strong faith that Riot will emerge from the recent turmoil a an example for other gaming and tech company to live up to 
Riot is always willing to listen to feedback and learn from it mistake 
The company 's not perfect , but it aspires to correct it imperfection at every opportunity 
I fear that some Rioters take for granted how much voice and empowerment they have here 
This is n't a corporate atmosphere , and it show in everything we do 
Riot is a place that doe n't just talk about it 's value but work every day to live them 
If you want to come to work every day thinking about how to deliver incredible value to player around the world then you will have a hard time finding a better fit than Riot 
If you 're part of the `` in-crowd '' and fancy yourself a core member of a fratty group of predominantly male gamers , go for it 
There is a great culture of gamers and people passionate about what they do 
There is unparalleled transparency into what the company 's goal are and what they want to do 
Encouraging 1:1s and prioritizing transparency are thing that I think Riot brings with it from the early day that are still working 
Good people , good benefit , great culture 
Great culture , wonderful people , incredible campus and a company that truly care about it 's employee and player ! 
Most everthing ; the benefit , the culture , the work 
It feel like a truly unique place in Gaming created by Gamers 
It 's very common to hear that we `` hire to elevate '' so that each new hire always push the bar higher , or at the very least this is the genuine intent 
But most importantly I feel that the company care about me a individual and valuing my contribution and provides numerous opportunity to learn and develop my skill 
The company ’ s culture is very appealing if you ’ re a gamer and often I found myself volunteering my time because I wanted to get something done 
I believe that you own that relationship with the company 100 % 
That said , I think that the leadership “ walk the walk ” when it come to our core value and being laser focused on our audience 
Great culture 
They want to make thing the best way 
Great people , culture , forward thinking company with a bright future 
The culture is exactly what you would expect from a gaming start up 
Great culture 
Free food Clear passion throughout the company for the product and player Good benefit 
I love that everyone is treated with respect and trust , rather than having intense level of micromanagement to account for the lowest possible denominator 
Culture is super important here , but that mean we all have a common thread that bind u together , which is really nice after working at company where there ’ s nothing connecting employee besides a paycheck 
) : Everyone love free stuff , but it speaks to Riot 's actual dedication to Rioters 
-Collaborative Culture : Due to Riot 's ( sometimes too ) lengthy hiring process , 99 % of Rioters are here because they care about player and making awesome stuff 
There may be some friction that stem from wanting to do their version of the `` right thing '' that conflict with someone else 's vision 
The collaborative culture ( see above ) mean plenty of meeting and stakeholder check , but even those are not nearly a burdensome a other company 
A flat organization , engineering driven culture 
Strong culture , so it 's easy to make a lot of friend if you 're hired 
Young workforce , both in real age and attitude 
Gamer focused 
Very good about recognizing those who excel and contribute meanfully 
People here are passionate , driven , hungry and greedy 
They 're never satisfied , always going forward , and the higher ups treat everyone incredibly well 
An absolutely incredible place to work with a huge amount of respect and care for employee , endless perk that at time feel more like Hogwarts than real life , and a strong , well-established culture 
From the first day , you will feel that Riot Games is a very different company from any other tech company out there 
Feel empowered to pursue what I believe in and supported by a company that doe it best to do right by the player 
Riot ha the physical space of a college campus full of friendly , talented nerd who adore game , film , TV , and other art 
CULTURE : The company culture is so open , thoughtful , and friendly 
It 's a gamer's/geek 's paradise 
Best cafeteria -Pays for work trip -Does encourage on site socializing -Believes in collaboration -Very accomdating towards personal need -Always put the player happiness first 
This is a place where you feel valued AND challenged ; challenged to bring your A-game at every turn 
Everyone care a lot about Riot 's collective success 
This review is skewed toward that perspective 
Riot ha a bottom-up culture that value employee making decision instead of management dictating them 
We like good game and we want to make them and play them 
There are a lot of thing I just love about this company : a ) Riot put player first 
As a gamer all my life this is a wonderful position to be in 
That mean if ever practice are put in place that are harmful to Rioters , the player , or the business itself people are ok with owning up to it and changing it 
g ) There 's a lot of different initiative I started since I 've been at this company and the fact that Riot embrace this entrepreneurial spirit is awesome 
This trust is a result of an admittedly grueling interview process in most discipline that try to ensure that you are player-focused ( you 'll use your autonomy to make the right thing for the player ) and that you are a master of your discipline ( you 'll use your autonomy to make thing the right way ) 
Candid feedback is encouraged , solicited , common and responded to 
It also is one of the few place I 've experienced where the passion of the employee directly translates into how they act with one another , how decision are made about the experience being delivered to player , and how the company is run on a day to day basis 
It is a wonderfully supportive company by any standard , and compared with other gaming company , it 's no contest 
The people here are high achiever , result-driven , and above all , self-critical , which minimum of ego 
You are not babied and are feel responsible for the company 's well-being 
Their investment into other piece of the player experience ( music , video , esports , etc ) , is a real reflection of their commitment to the player and delivering value anywhere ( and any way ) they can 
You 'll be surrounded by some of the most talented people in the field , many of who embody `` work hard , play hard 
Many Rioters are there for the right reason and want to do what 's best for Riot , even if the working environment doe n't always make it clear what that is 
Player focus is more than marketing 
Riot work very hard to stay driven and humble through success and failure 
Riot is a company of gamers who place the player first ! This is true in the development team ( like many game company ) and it is also true in sale , finance , people ( HR ) and upper management 
Riot value the player and demand that it employee think of the player value of their action 
Riot is also a company that place a great deal of autonomy in small team and individual 
I 'm on an energetic team who is deeply invested in what we do 
I 'm reminded every day to think what is best for the player , and how we deliver value 
No one is going to baby you here 
* Player-oriented , global focus mean that the company is actively trying to make decision that positively impact the customer 
This is not just lip-service ; cost discussion nearly always take a backseat to player concern 
* Executive leadership make it a point to be accessible and transparent and seem to honestly believe in cultural value 
* The vast majority of Rioters are A-type personality who get thing done and are not afraid to challenge bad decision when they see them 
Everyone understands that they are on the same team and work fervently to support you when possible 
* Trying and failing is encouraged and actively de-stigmatized 
* From a QA perspective , QA is generally seen a valued work and you are treated well 
Rioters culturally aligned 
Company motivated to deliver the best player experience possible 
Vast majority of Rioters embody the Riot manifesto , and are receptive to critical feedback 
The culture and workplace is amazing 
Always looking to do right by their player and product 
Brandon & Marc have their mind & heart in the right place , their value and belief are truly transformative for the gaming industry and it show in their vision for League of Legends and eSports 
The company invests in people and it show 
Gamer culture 
if something is a good idea , we do it whether it involves the game , benefit , our people , etc 
focused on continuous improvement and delighting our player 
Despite Riot growing super fast over the last few year every Rioter I 've met seems to really fit the culture 
Incredibly open , laid back culture 
Things are n't sugar-coated , and you have to have thick skin to work here , but what this mean is that if you 're doing something that is n't working or is at odds with the culture , you 're able to course-correct quickly 
`` Gamer '' humor is injected into most company-wide communication , which help add to our mantra of `` not taking ourselves too seriously 
We 're redefining what it mean to have test-driven development , and the result on the holistic product quality show 
Riot is a place that reward self-directed type-As who go above and beyond for player fueled by their passion 
Our open and trusting culture that we love requires u to hire new Rioters with great vigilance ; `` with great freedom come great responsibility 
Summary in the beginning : * Great culture * Great learning opportunity * Good long term vision from Senior Leadership , even if not always explicit * Great attitude towards the end goal ( making player 's experience better ) * Great perk * Great IT and Facility team , which make a lot of thing easier The culture is great and foster trust and teamwork rather than individual achievement 
The entire company is focused on the interest of the player 
Very strong on culture , which in my opinion is a positive thing 
Company heavily focus on player empathy across the board , even folk in non game production / design related role ( i 
On that note , the founder are both passionate gamers and have an incredibly long view on everything 
Take play seriously 5 
Stay hungry , stay humble The evidence of these pillar are seen in the people that work at Riot 
Very much a work hard , play hard mentality Great fringe benefit ( like Vegas / Cruise ) Great pay for the role Noob Training ! Amazing talent Company able to do truly ground breaking thing Everything is about delivering player value 
Conscious care go to making sure Riot is PLAYER FOCUSED , and the best they can be 
Riot really is actively trying to improve , and be the highest quality game company they can 
The commitment to their IP , and their player is 2nd to none 
Company culture is generally open , very understanding of a life outside the office 
Across the organization , team celebrate accomplishment in a rewarding way 
[ + ] Good culture 
everyone know Riot 's value internally and life by them 
This company is truly dedicated to the player experience 
[ + ] Spotless ethic – this company conduct business cleanly and fairly 
You ’ ll feel this when interacting with peer internally ( there ’ s no backstabbing and people uphold the ideal of sportsmanship ) and externally 
[ + ] Fun environment – As a result of Riot ’ s full-time focus on creating fun for player , we try to make sure that fun ’ s part of the daily work environment 
[ + ] Mission-driven 
It ’ s never “ just a game ” to u because we think that entertainment and playfulness are a core human need , coming in right after those other Maslovian essential like food , shelter , and sexy time 
This is a company of people dedicated to serving that need 
Believes in it mission 
Humble but challenging the norm 
The best part of Riot is that despite the massive growth , the company ha remained a a place for ambitious high-performers who are passionate gamers and want to make great thing for other gamers 
Player focused is not just a mantra ; there are often heated debate about what that mean , but it 's very rare to encounter anyone who is apathetic to player concern 
The culture ha been maintained despite scaling up 
Riot remains steadfastly dedicated to upholding the tenet that the company wa founded on 
Leadership ha a high level of integrity and vision 
The startup mentality ha n't died off with the rapid growth 
Lots of potential if the management and cultural issue get fixed 
You 're working for a company that genuinely care about their player and adding value to the product we build 
We welcome challenge , open feedback , and cross-collaboration 
We focus on hiring talented individual that care about our player 
The only string attached is that you have to follow the status quo 
The status quo will not be challenged 
`` Riot belief in it cultural manifesto 
Culture drive everything , but it 's not a simple a reading and consenting to the manifesto 
Riot culture is a mirror through which Rioters reflect on whether we 're winning or losing both a a company and a individual , and it requires ongoing introspection even after year of working here 
Riot take good care of it employee and strives to create a work environment that is fun and challenging 
Culture is the set of shared value we can agree upon a being important to u and describing who we aspire to be 
During the interview process , candidate are screened not only on their raw qualification ( what have they accomplished , can they perform the job function ) , but on whether they demonstrate clear alignment with Riot 's cultural value 
Yearly 360-Reviews break feedback down into category aligned with the cultural manifesto 
Culture is prized more than raw technical ability in a hire 
A candidate may be intellectually brilliant or driven , but will not make it through if they seem to lack humility or a default orientation toward succeeding a a team versus a an individual 
`` Senior '' individual are not looked at a merely having greater expertise than their peer or having higher throughput 
They 're primarily viewed a people who are able to create an environment or atmosphere that remove obstacle and make their peer feel empowered 
Everything is done a part of a team 
Leaders at Riot want to clarify goal and expectation , but unless you 're an associate level , they do n't want to tell you what to do or how to do it 
But individual Rioters are expected to own this themselves and figure out what need to be done 
Lastly , on the positive side , Riot 's culture of open feedback ha created an environment where everything mentioned in this review ( both in pro here and the con below ) can be ( and are regularly ) discussed openly 
but it is an organization that craves feedback and opportunity to learn how to be better all the time 
The people and the culture are top of the line at Riot 
Culturally this place is intense you have to be a true believer in the company and it 's mission in order to get along 
But it is precisely that culture that allows Riot to continue to grow and create the right product for player 
Everyone is passionate about what they do , and everyone want to see the company and our game succeed 
Going the extra mile is the standard , not the deviation 
Empowerment > > we 're not necessarily a flat org a we are an empowering org 
Supportive attitude from management to staff interacting directly with the playerbase ( forum etc ) 
Young , modern , innovative , giving their employee all the freedom to grow , secure and always challenging , though I had a lot of offer from other company in the past I 've always turned them down 
People that work here are very valued 
It 's a great campus and there 's a great , creative vibe 
Unique , fun environment , awesome culture , incredible opportunity 
Most Rioters really do believe in the manifesto and try and do what is right for the player a often a possible 
you are surrounded by smart , passionate people who deeply care about the experience of player and who share an ambitious vision of making gaming better for gamers 
If you are n't , Riot is n't for you 
Continues to be a place with strong cultural identity with a huge amount of energy and camaraderie 
This kind of agility at this scale is still something Riot should be very , very proud of 
The people 
fiercely passionate and mostly genuine 
While the perk are nice , it 's our cultural aspiration and my awesome co-worker that keep me here 
In a landscape littered with profit-maximizing soulless bureaucratic corporation , it 's nice to see Marc and Brandon stand up for what they believe is right : to be the most player-focused game company in the world and to respect the folk delivering on that dream 
There 's a real , deep seated belief that if we keep customer and employee happy that prosperity will follow 
Great Culture 
-A lot of opportunity to learn from peer and outside source -Great benefit -Laid back , but extremely productive office culture -Everyone is held accountable for their work 
If you have a high drive to succeed and are result oriented you 'll do fine 
Leadership is transparent and open to feedback 
We care deeply about our player and our Rioters 
Mission : Riot is so authentically committed to it mission 
Not only am I empowered and encouraged to be myself , being at Riot ha help mature me into the best version of me 
Rioters care so earnestly about leveling one another up , the growth is exponential 
Autonomy and entrepreneurial spirit : Rioters are expected to write their own story 
What this mean is we ’ re in an environment where we ’ re encouraged to pursue big idea , and find way to make them real , but a a team 
Culture : This is what make Riot special 
Riot ha such a firm sense of who we are , and who we ’ re not 
The Riot Manifesto is real inside our wall , and there are story for each one 
It ’ s also a crucible 
People : Rioters are the most passionate people I ’ ve ever met 
Most Rioters are interested in working a team to achieve awesome stuff , and are not interested in drama or nasty-politicking 
The Riot Social scene is awesome 
Culture is probably the biggest Pro in my mind 
The people here are genuinely passionate about League player and a player first mentality drive nearly all of our initiative 
In addition , senior leader strongly believe in empowering team to own their own success 
* Player-oriented , global focus mean that the company is actively trying to make decision that positively impact the customer 
This is not just lip-service ; cost discussion nearly always take a backseat to player concern 
* Executive leadership make it a point to be accessible and transparent and seem to honestly believe in cultural value 
* The vast majority of Rioters are A-type personality who get thing done and are not afraid to challenge bad decision when they see them 
Everyone understands that they are on the same team and work fervently to support you when possible 
* Trying and failing is encouraged and actively de-stigmatized 
* From a QA perspective , QA is generally seen a valued work and you are treated well 
This trust is a result of an admittedly grueling interview process in most discipline that try to ensure that you are player-focused ( you 'll use your autonomy to make the right thing for the player ) and that you are a master of your discipline ( you 'll use your autonomy to make thing the right way ) 
Candid feedback is encouraged , solicited , common and responded to 
Riot is a company made up of gamers , and for that reason the culture in the office is centered around gaming 
In adopting the open PTO policy , Riot decided to put the onus of taking vacation on the employee 
If you 're able to stand your ground and push forward with what you believe is the right thing to do , even in the face of intense personality , conflict and sometimes derailment , this is the place for you 
Riot is a place that reward self-directed type-As who go above and beyond for player fueled by their passion 
Our open and trusting culture that we love requires u to hire new Rioters with great vigilance ; `` with great freedom come great responsibility 
Louis , and if you 're looking for a great place to grow , learn and have fun Riot is it 
* Culture 
Business value that are built on real , human virtue : I get to talk about think like humility , kindness , thoughtfulness , passion , curiosity , craftsmanship and emotional intelligence and these thing resonate with those around me to the extent that I 've watched Rioters grow faster a a direct result of focusing on these virtue 
An unbelievable level of dedication to the player and the product / feature that express that dedication : Working at Riot ha made me realized the subtle way in past work that I 've compromised on the principle of being truly engaged with the thing I wa building 
In order to make this real every day , Rioters have to posse strong self-awareness , situational awareness , an upbeat sense of togetherness and an ever-present entrepreneurial streak 
I 'm surrounded by people with whom I can default to trust ; people I know will have my back whenever I need it ( not just when I ask for it ) 
They have a genuine determination to build thing of value and to have fun while they do it 
As a matter of determination , Riot is not a fairytale 
Like anything worthwhile and enduring , it take love , work and faith 
One of the thing I like most about Riot ( and the way I know it 's not a cult or some sort of fraternity ) is the level of recognition it ha collectively that 'getting it wrong ' is a normal part of doing something of value 
The fact that Riot ha such a strong feedback culture and that Rioters take their duty of care to each others ' development so seriously is what ha allowed Riot to retain it soul a it ha scaled 
In summary , Rioters keep trying , with humility , to do better in the face of success and failure 
They do this , overwhelmingly , without compromising their principle 
This is the very definition of character and it is what make me most proud to be a member of this family 
Riot not only creates the environment and the culture for you to innovate and come up with crazy idea , but also empowers and support you every step of the way 
The core value of the company are truly awesome 
Make sure you quickly understand which core value the company is living versus one they are aspiring to ( A 
Riot really care about it 's Rioters 
I 'm on an energetic team who is deeply invested in what we do 
I 'm reminded every day to think what is best for the player , and how we deliver value 
No one is going to baby you here 
Riot is a company of gamers who place the player first ! This is true in the development team ( like many game company ) and it is also true in sale , finance , people ( HR ) and upper management 
Riot value the player and demand that it employee think of the player value of their action 
Riot is also a company that place a great deal of autonomy in small team and individual 
Riot is a place that doe n't just talk about it 's value but work every day to live them 
If you want to come to work every day thinking about how to deliver incredible value to player around the world then you will have a hard time finding a better fit than Riot 
Caring and Thoughtful Company Culture 
Riot ha some of the smartest people I 've worked with in game and tech who are also humble , unassuming and genuinely aligned around a common goal of making great experience for gamers around the world 
Culture support learning and growth mindset and continuous improvement of people , process , and product 
Riot remains steadfastly dedicated to upholding the tenet that the company wa founded on 
Leadership ha a high level of integrity and vision 
The startup mentality ha n't died off with the rapid growth 
Culture is key at Riot , and if you `` fit in '' with their mindset , you will have an amazing opportunity to impact the organization no matter what position you hold 
Management is always willing to listen to your feedback and in fact , encourages you to speak-up when you feel something is going in the wrong direction , or need improvement 
This is not a place where you can do the minimum and just skirt by ; this is a high-performance , demanding , but fun place to work 
Passion ( for your job , the company and the game ) , determination ( no constraint ) , and a high-level of accountability are some of the key attribute they look for in Rioters 
Not that they have to , but because of the culture that compels them to do so 
Drink the Riot kool-aide and magical thing will happen 
You get to work with some really awesome people , passionate about what they are doing The culture is the best part about the company , though some who have lost their ambition are able to stick around for longer than they should Feedback is open , but sometimes ignored 
Passionate people 
Amazing colleague that are truly passionate about what they do Focus on Culture Genuine passion for Players Amazing facility and company event 
The Culture within Riot is really amazing , and highly enjoyable 
There is also a culture of constructive feedback that allows everyone to evolve constantly and that go both way 
Great culture , with an unique passion for delivering value to customer 
Employees are passionate about the company and the product 
Great culture ! Feeling at ease with the people around you make it easier to work and make the work you produce better 
Riot ha a very open-feedback culture : Everyone feel empowered to give feedback on anything , and you will have no problem getting feedback when you request it 
* If you love game , this is a company by gamers for gamers , full stop 
* The compensation is reasonably good * Only company I 've ever seen that actually belief in and hire for it cultural value * Broad ability and trust in line level employee 
having your rear in a seat 
Incredibly open , laid back culture 
Things are n't sugar-coated , and you have to have thick skin to work here , but what this mean is that if you 're doing something that is n't working or is at odds with the culture , you 're able to course-correct quickly 
`` Gamer '' humor is injected into most company-wide communication , which help add to our mantra of `` not taking ourselves too seriously 
We 're redefining what it mean to have test-driven development , and the result on the holistic product quality show 
Riot Games belief in the talent that they let through their door by empowering them to pursue what they are passionate about 
They trust that every Rioter is highly competent and capable and allow them the freedom to take on short term productivity loss for long term development gain 
We truly live our manifesto 
Riot 's corporate integrity is beyond admirable 
Everyone really belief in the product and are passionate about what they do 
This is n't a corporate atmosphere , and it show in everything we do 
Really awesome culture with a great desire to build a world-class , global organization 
It 's not just an empty slogan , but really in the vein of everything we do 
Riot ha a very mature approach and work ethic 
Everyone is incredibly enthusiastic about League of Legends , and that genuine passion is infectious 
Culture : Almost everything about Riot I 'd describe a `` high energy , '' dialed up to eleven 
The culture is hugely focused on self-improvement and iteration 
There are a lot of thing I just love about this company : a ) Riot put player first 
As a gamer all my life this is a wonderful position to be in 
That mean if ever practice are put in place that are harmful to Rioters , the player , or the business itself people are ok with owning up to it and changing it 
g ) There 's a lot of different initiative I started since I 've been at this company and the fact that Riot embrace this entrepreneurial spirit is awesome 
Empowerment > > we 're not necessarily a flat org a we are an empowering org 
The best part of Riot is that despite the massive growth , the company ha remained a a place for ambitious high-performers who are passionate gamers and want to make great thing for other gamers 
Player focused is not just a mantra ; there are often heated debate about what that mean , but it 's very rare to encounter anyone who is apathetic to player concern 
The culture ha been maintained despite scaling up 
Conscious care go to making sure Riot is PLAYER FOCUSED , and the best they can be 
Riot really is actively trying to improve , and be the highest quality game company they can 
The commitment to their IP , and their player is 2nd to none 
We like good game and we want to make them and play them 
People working here really do love their work and try their best to do what is best for the player in the long term , even when we do n't succeed 
This trickle down throughout the organization 
-A lot of opportunity to learn from peer and outside source -Great benefit -Laid back , but extremely productive office culture -Everyone is held accountable for their work 
Everything the company doe is to give the League of Legends player the best experience 
Super intense culture , result focused , top tier talent 
Smart capable teammate , focus on individual growth , great product 
Great general culture that sometimes feel to relaxed 
Riot is a place that try to aspire to always be better -- it 's a mindset that I resonate with and what drew me to the company 
+Feedback culture +Good people +Company perk 
fun and dynamic , true to it value 
Great people , great culture , smartest people I 've ever worked with 
What make Riot a great company is it culture 
it dedication to putting the Player first 
This stem from the vision and passion of it founder ( Marc and Brandon ) and it permeates from the top to the bottom of the organization 
The secret sauce that separate Riot from other game company is that most other game company are founded by successful game developer who become businessmen by necessity ; while Riot wa founded by businessmen who love game , who understand how to run a business and understand how important the right culture is to a stellar company , and have enough self-confidence to hire and trust people with expertise they do not have ( like engineering and game design ) 
[ + ] Culture : Openness , excellence , self-awareness , team-focus , low-to-no politics 
Note `` Player '' focus , not `` Customer '' focus ; that is , focus on the experience for everyone in the game , whether they pay money or not 
This sincere , almost maniacal , focus on our relationship with our Players is the core of Riot 's success 
And who are not afraid to hire people smarter than themselves 
Ethical 
[ + ] Unafraid to part way : Able to identify people who are not a good culture fit or are underperforming ; working with and coaching them to help them meet the bar ; but not being afraid to let them go if a path to improvement can not be found 
Believes in it mission 
Humble but challenging the norm 
Esprit de corp is high , with lot of enthusiastic and hard-working co-worker 
there is no such thing a stepping on toe 
bottom up culture , not top down 
leader serve , not rule ( I am one of the leader ) 
full of culture 
[ + ] Good culture 
everyone know Riot 's value internally and life by them 
This company is truly dedicated to the player experience 
[ + ] Spotless ethic – this company conduct business cleanly and fairly 
You ’ ll feel this when interacting with peer internally ( there ’ s no backstabbing and people uphold the ideal of sportsmanship ) and externally 
[ + ] Fun environment – As a result of Riot ’ s full-time focus on creating fun for player , we try to make sure that fun ’ s part of the daily work environment 
[ + ] Mission-driven 
It ’ s never “ just a game ” to u because we think that entertainment and playfulness are a core human need , coming in right after those other Maslovian essential like food , shelter , and sexy time 
This is a company of people dedicated to serving that need 
I rated Riot 5 star because the company is a great fit for me 
But tied to that is the expectation that they are going to deliver phenomenal work consistently ( keeping in mind that one-off mistake are okay and considered good learning experience 
Extremely strong gamer culture that focus deeply on serving our audience 
good culture good atmosphere love the people 
Founders set a great culture of truly caring for player and Rioters 
Incredibly passionate and talented coworkers and leadership Leadership care about employee True focus on our player first Empowerment to pursue your idea and personal growth 
Most everthing ; the benefit , the culture , the work 
Culture of continual improvement 
Strong gamer culture ( a might be expected ) 
Despite Riot growing super fast over the last few year every Rioter I 've met seems to really fit the culture 
Typical game culture 
Gamers through and through 
Very much a work hard , play hard mentality Great fringe benefit ( like Vegas / Cruise ) Great pay for the role Noob Training ! Amazing talent Company able to do truly ground breaking thing Everything is about delivering player value 
A level of passion for the product and it 's player that is unmatched by any gaming company 
Very good about recognizing those who excel and contribute meanfully 
The people , The people , The people 
But of course to have reason WHY something should be a certain way and follow though with it 
The WHY is what make this place great 
Great Culture 
Great culture 
Good people , good benefit , great culture 
passionate people 
very good in roit ，i like it 
great culture 
And culture 
All of the company have their plus , but at Riot , people really care about our player 
The office perk are exceptional , and Riot treat it 's employee like family 
Quick Points : Great , open feedback culture ; Highly transparent and trusting of everyone that work here ; Amazing perk that include a yearly trip ; A team dedicated to ensuring that people are taken care of , and extending that to your family a well ; Tons of learning and development opportunity ; Challenges of scale , technology , and craft that will keep you sharp ; Failure is ok , but learn from it and move on 
+ Riot ha really unique culture of hiring and keeping great talented people who are humble , smart , passionate for game and for gamers community 
I see how getting great culturally aligned people together build the trust and high level of result 
The culture is really special and unique and it is this which make working at Riot so great 
Everyone is passionate and driven to achieve ; we ’ re committed to delivering a fantastic player experience and we ’ re always looking to improve 
You ’ re given a great deal of autonomy and expected to own and run with initiative 
This refreshing and unique culture ha helped my wife and I to feel settled in Sydney 
this make for an awesome culture within the studio , offering huge opportunity to learn from one another , and is a lot of fun ! One close knit team , all sharing the same mission 
Sure it 's about finding the best talent , but it 's equally about making sure that everyone hired fit the company culture ? So what is culture , is it 'we all like to joke around and have fun whilst we work ' ? No , it 's the core value that Riot ha 
that our player are our first concern , that we need to do our best for them at all time , that we need to always be improving 
Being in an environment where everyone share the same value a I do is incredible 
I 'm now encouraged to follow my instinct , to push the envelope , to make mistake , try new thing , to unlock my imagination and drive any project I believe will bring our player benefit 
Culture & Values : is a company run by gamers and we base every decision thinking `` what I would want from a company in this case ? '' 
Empowerment : you are encouraged to do what you think is good for the player 
The culture is also amazing , people are really encouraged to give candid feedback and help you grow and develop a a professional 
Riot live by it 's philosophy of being the most player focused company in the world , meaning you have the autonomy to create great thing that player will love , and see your work impacting people around the globe 
* Riot accepts no constraint 
`` Culture ' is n't just a buzzword here 
Most Rioters share this invisible bond of common value , ambition , belief and work ethic 
Almost everyone here is a hardcore gamer , though there is no hostility towards those who do n't play much 
`` Geek brotherhood '' feeling is very strong here , though 
for a corporation of it size and wealth , it 's still operates in accordance with it player-centric approach from early day 
The headquarter basically decides and ha authority on whatever need to be the same everyone ( like champion balance , company culture or the company logo ) , while the local office decide and have authority on stuff that are specific to their territory ( like local e-sports , local feature , local community , etc… ) 
This mean : no dotted line reporting to another office , no back and forth approval over the ocean , no budget limit set by someone who doesn ’ t know your market , etc… If you are an entrepreneur and love action , building stuff and accountability , this is great 
Culture 
Riot is super picky when it come to maintaining it culture in the company 
What ha been great is the company ha not compromised on this when expanding into other country 
This wa tricky a some of the Riot culture principle go against the local culture 
As a example , the culture of performance and the principle of exiting poor performer which is unusual in some country 
Or the culture of direct and transparent feedback which is sometimes quite unusual in some asian culture 
It helped ciment the culture in the office and have the new hire integrate in the culture right away 
The office won ’ t compromise on culture fit for new hire , even if it mean hiring slower than we ’ d want 
As a result , the company culture is also transparent in the Hong Kong office 
The office is really nice , and capture the same spirit , color scheme and comfort than HQ… with a great view a a plus ! The other benefit is the location : it is based in Central , which mean it is pretty accessible from anywhere in Hong Kong with massive public transportation network ( bus , subway , ferry , escalator , etc… ) -- -- Team size 
An empowering company , that ha solid core value that are lived every day in every decision ( to understand more look at the company mission statement ) 
The culture at Riot is not just talked about but it is expressed in the action and word of all Rioters 
Every place I have worked ha had a set of `` core value '' , but only 2 of them have ever really shown some belief in those value ( Riot being one of them ) , and only Riot ha fully nailed them from aspiration to execution , while truly living those value through their action , extending to ( and especially in ) the `` customer service '' side of the business 
Below are some bullet of the thing that make Riot the top of the list for me : Ethos/Culture 
What you do prof what you believe 
The Riot Manifesto is n't just some catchy word or phrase that a group of exec put together to communicate what they aspire to be a an organization 
It is n't pasted around the office on brightly colored poster pontificating how you should behave to be a Rioter 
The Manifesto and it 's guiding principle are the foundation of every action , decision , and endeavor that Riot undertakes 
Each individual is able to articulate how their contribution impact the player experience , and while the recruitment process is brutal ( more on that later ) , it is designed to identify those that share a deep connection with and belief in those principle 
Riot 's philosophy on hiring extreme talent with shared ethos and passion ha resulted in a work space that is continuously stimulating with healthy , engaging debate , conversation , and work 
Passion/Engagement 
That is because everyone share that common ethos and a passion , not just for League of Legends and gaming in general , but for achieving excellence and mastery 
And if excellence ha been achieved , they celebrate it 
It is an endless quest for perfection in a group of people that love what they do 
The culture is great and positive most of the time , and you can default to trust with most colleague 
Riot is built around a heavy focus on it people , it really care about their comfort and doe a lot to try to be a great working environment 
Great company culture that care about every one in the company 
Management is open and transparent with any and all question 
Excellent team culture , lot of opportunity for growth 
Culture 
Flexible Hours Great Culture Growth Mindset Compensation rate are well above average 
* Coworkers genuinely invested in the success and player enjoyment of game 
Good company culture and nice campus 
Great culture 
Autonomy and respect employee 
Relaxed culture , not too many place in the org where you will find hard deadline , and even in the case where there are there is not a lot of pressure from management or leadership 
Open feedback culture take getting used to , but overall I 've seen a lot of professional growth come from it 
Management and coworkers have always been extremely supportive 
Marc and Brandon were truly inspirational founder , who gave generously back to their staff , more than wa needed 
people centric environment and lot of time to get thing right 
fun campus 
Particularly over the last few month a Riot put out new game , the vision for the company is increasingly clear 
Passionate people , Matrixed environment , Great benefit , failure that lead to learning are accepted 
Strong empowering culture , truly player focused 
Tons of learning opportunity Lots of freedom and ambiguity Feedback culture Super smart colleague in many business function Enjoyable people 
People , focus , location of office 
Dedicated people Actual gamers Does everything for the player 
The perk are generally excellent , but it 's the ethos and the other Rioters that really make it special 
CULTURE : The company culture is so open , thoughtful , and friendly 
It 's a gamer's/geek 's paradise 
Great vibe and people 
For such a large company it shocking how often Riot try to do the right thing for their player and how much effort is put in to staying connected to player 
Teams share their goal , so there 's vested interest from the rest of your team in every line of code you write 
* The people 
Louis , and if you 're looking for a great place to grow , learn and have fun Riot is it 
* Culture 
Company genuinely belief and try to live a player-first mentality ( even if not always successful ) 
My perspective is the sum of my personal experience at Riot over 4 
The only string attached is that you have to follow the status quo 
The status quo will not be challenged 
Passionate People 
Progressive Culture 
Additionally , the open culture encourages you to make time to meet and build relationship with people that you may never cross path with otherwise 
At it core , Riot is humble 
Clearly , mistake have been made , but when flaw or failure are identified Riot not only strives to fix them , but also hold itself highly accountable for them happening in the first place 
Steps are being taken to properly identify and remove bad actor , a well a ensure that every person here understands how to be their best self and how to combat wrongdoing 
I have strong faith that Riot will emerge from the recent turmoil a an example for other gaming and tech company to live up to 
Riot is always willing to listen to feedback and learn from it mistake 
The company 's not perfect , but it aspires to correct it imperfection at every opportunity 
I fear that some Rioters take for granted how much voice and empowerment they have here 
Individuals and team are empowered to chart their own course 
Riot ha a very high hiring bar ( from both a craft and a culture perspective ) , and it show 
Gamer Culture 
It 's not just an empty slogan , but really in the vein of everything we do 
Riot ha a very mature approach and work ethic 
The people , The people , The people 
But of course to have reason WHY something should be a certain way and follow though with it 
The WHY is what make this place great 
Player Focused : Every decision and detail at Riot is made from the perspective of the player 
Constantly getting better : Everyone here want to constantly improve 
we know we could always be better at what we do so pushing ourselves and stretching for difficult to achieve goal make this a motivating place to work 
Badassery in full effect ! Riot focus on hiring amazing people to tackle sweet project and ha a philosophy of making sure people have ton of autonomy to get thing done 
A core management principle of Riot 's is to manage by goal-setting and holding people accountable for result ( the ultimate result being player happiness ) 
Another element of Riot 's winning culture is the incredible focus on hiring talented people 
Everyone is passionate about what they do , and everyone want to see the company and our game succeed 
Going the extra mile is the standard , not the deviation 
Great focus on strong value ( merit , creative problem-solving , result , and people ) 
+Great work environment +Constantly pushing boundary +Very intelligent , passionate , and innovative people +Young crowd who are n't set in old industry standard +Exciting and expanding brand +Occasional time-off and group perk 
From the minute you join the company , their culture wholly embrace a growth mindset 
If you 're part of the `` in-crowd '' and fancy yourself a core member of a fratty group of predominantly male gamers , go for it 
But , I 've never seen Riot accept the status quo 
we reflect , we own our mistake , and we commit to improving 
I love that everyone is treated with respect and trust , rather than having intense level of micromanagement to account for the lowest possible denominator 
Culture is super important here , but that mean we all have a common thread that bind u together , which is really nice after working at company where there ’ s nothing connecting employee besides a paycheck 
The people , the culture , the product , the perk 
They 're one of a handful of company in gaming that belief their best asset are the people that make the game 
The people 
fiercely passionate and mostly genuine 
Open feedback culture ha helped me grow tremendously 
Not only that , but everyone is kind , and go out of their way to be kind 
Highly Collaborative : open culture of constructive feedback is truly in effect , and you are expected to contribute 
Truly a gamer culture : people are passionate about good game from top to bottom 
This gift is so valuable to me that I feel a duty to pas it on to others in the org 
Truly awesome co-worker , deep interpersonal bond between Rioters , awesome culture and social environment 
I have made deep lifelong connection at Riot that I will always cherish 
When Riot 's culture life up to it ideal ( which it often doe , at least on LoL ) , it feel soooo good to work there -- people are rational , open-minded , Socratic , authentic , funny , kind , and competent 
great growth mindset 
gaming focused culture 
True to the manifesto 
There is trust among u to do what is right 
Everyone care a lot about Riot 's collective success 
Founders set a great culture of truly caring for player and Rioters 
[LISTSEP]
 Focus on players 
 Pro of working at the Hong Kong Studio is the autonomy and space given as we are still small scale
 Player focused
 Personally I love that, as it makes us able to be flexible and we can make things happen, but that kind of environment isn't everyone's cup of tea
 It is great to be with a company where you can be more than your job 
 You will do your job and there is the expectation of delivering on it but you will also play lots of games, you will be part of projects not linked to your core role, you will do esports, you will be part of the community, you can have a say and you can be part of everything going on
 The office is free to make the decision they believe is right for the players
 you are expected to deliver but no one is going to be micro managing you
The game is amazing and it's been a pleasure to work on it
 Work isn't so stressful
 Flexible working hours
 What you do with your working hours in no one's business
 Getting to play games during work is a great plus (though this doesn't mean you should neglect your responsibilities)
 Overall, it's been a great experience working here thus far, and while at times the workload has been difficult, I find myself always excited to go to work, to learn from fellow Rioters (and I've learned a lot), to challenge myself with responsibilities I would never get a chance to take on in previous jobs, to duo queue with other Rioters, and for smoothies on Tuesday mornings
 • I recently had some personal challenges and it was impacting my work – instead of getting reprimanded, my manager asked how he could help and the result not only alleviated some stress, but actually helped me to resolve the issues I was having and take care of things at home
 Riot OCE has gotten better at onboarding since then, there's a multi-day program in an amazing office, games with the team and a new starter BBQ
 Everywhere else I have ever worked I go through a couple of months of 'new job honeymoon' where everything is exciting and time flies
 after 6 months you have it on lockdown and that's when I wouldn't be really challenging anymore and work starts to get procedural
 There are a lot of social events, Riot organised as well as just put together by people at work
 It's pretty common for someone organising anything from a trip to the cricket to a board games night or drinks at the pub to email the whole office or walk the floor asking who is up for it
 You are the person to manage your time
 You can spend all of your time to slack :p but actually no one does that, just because everyone comes here want to achieve something
 Play game at work 
 It is unimaginable in previous company but in Riot, you manage your own time
 You are free to relax to play games when you feel you are too stressed
 Somehow I found it is effective because I am more efficient when I get back to work after a game
 Flexible work hours ("We are worried if you are and can deliver, not in how are you going to do it"); 
 The offices are a really fun environment but still highly productive
 Teamwork
I've been at Riot Games Sydney for less than a year, but I have enjoyed the experience thoroughly
 We currently have a ~25 person office
 In trust we work together
 I am working with some of the most intelligent people I have ever met, hands down
 Because the office is focused exclusively on China, there is little distraction about all the other things that happened across the company
 I am hardcore WoW player, and it's great to finally work at a company where I don't need to be embarrassed that I play games during work hours; as long as I get all my work done of course
 So I get to keep up with my Garrison Missions!
 Working on an amazing game 
 Occasional interactions with Riot HQ LoL amazing Dev Team
If you are a gamer it's the best place to work, play, grow, live
 No HQ vs local office
 Working on the best game in the world: this is probably bias because I've been playing / loving LOL since Season 1 but helping Riot making LOL even better is a honour for me
 Focus on players

Being here more than 3 year feel on the one hand shorter a going to work is still a fresh experience with many new face and working on our studio mission 
Pro of working at the Hong Kong Studio is the autonomy and space given a we are still small scale 
Player focused 
And while this policy is in place , employee feel more empowered to work on the project they love , instead of being limited to a certain job forever 
You will do your job and there is the expectation of delivering on it but you will also play lot of game , you will be part of project not linked to your core role , you will do esports , you will be part of the community , you can have a say and you can be part of everything going on 
you are expected to deliver but no one is going to be micro managing you 
Work is n't so stressful 
Flexible working hour 
What you do with your working hour in no one 's business 
Getting to play game during work is a great plus ( though this doe n't mean you should neglect your responsibility ) 
Overall , it 's been a great experience working here thus far , and while at time the workload ha been difficult , I find myself always excited to go to work , to learn from fellow Rioters ( and I 've learned a lot ) , to challenge myself with responsibility I would never get a chance to take on in previous job , to duo queue with other Rioters , and for smoothy on Tuesday morning 
• I recently had some personal challenge and it wa impacting my work – instead of getting reprimanded , my manager asked how he could help and the result not only alleviated some stress , but actually helped me to resolve the issue I wa having and take care of thing at home 
Riot OCE ha gotten better at onboarding since then , there 's a multi-day program in an amazing office , game with the team and a new starter BBQ 
It 's pretty common for someone organising anything from a trip to the cricket to a board game night or drink at the pub to email the whole office or walk the floor asking who is up for it 
You are the person to manage your time 
You can spend all of your time to slack : p but actually no one doe that , just because everyone come here want to achieve something 
Play game at work 
It is unimaginable in previous company but in Riot , you manage your own time 
You are free to relax to play game when you feel you are too stressed 
Somehow I found it is effective because I am more efficient when I get back to work after a game 
The office are a really fun environment but still highly productive 
I 've been at Riot Games Sydney for le than a year , but I have enjoyed the experience thoroughly 
I am hardcore WoW player , and it 's great to finally work at a company where I do n't need to be embarrassed that I play game during work hour ; a long a I get all my work done of course 
Working on an amazing game 
If you are a gamer it 's the best place to work , play , grow , live 
No HQ v local office 
Working on the best game in the world : this is probably bias because I 've been playing / loving LOL since Season 1 but helping Riot making LOL even better is a honour for me 
My wife for example is not a gamer and she did n't really understand why `` I wanted '' to stay late at work to finish project for our player ( btw , nobody force you nor nobody make you feel bad if you leave at 6 ) 
That mean employee are given a lot of freedom to choose what they want to devote their time towards 
However , this is partly because none of the manager have time to do micro-managing 
I ca n't think of a single person I do n't enjoy working with , and I collaborate on a lot of cross-functional project 
it 's great to be able to bond with coworkers by playing the game there 
+ You feel like you 're getting quality work done , but it never feel like a chore to be at work 
I got a great increase to come over , and there are many perk I never had at previous job that help me balance work/life and save on cost 
I 'm here until pretty late every day , but most of the time it 's because I took a long lunch or had an after-work Riot event or something 
Basically , I love working here and it 's the first place in the nearly 7 year I 've been working that I feel like I could see myself staying with for more than a couple of year 
I 'm genuinely excited to be at work everyday 
People game LoL and other game during the day at work , which is so awesome 
video game at work 
I get constant satisfaction knowing that our collective work impact the 100 million+ people that play League of Legends each month 
Work/life balance 
Riot ha an amazing work/life balance 
There 's also an amazing coffee shop , snack-loaded kitchen , and friendly support staff 
It 's easy to balance life and work a schedule can often be worked out on a per-team basis 
I have had more fun in my first 6 month here than I have in the past decade plus of software development 
Riot allowed me to be creative , productive , and free from title and politics 
There 's definitely a high regard for their employee and the work/life balance 
Encouraged to Play game at work Free Gourmet Cafeteria with Delicious food Free `` Starbucks-ish '' cafe with all you can drink ( non-alcoholic ) caffeinated drink & munchies Fun Activities onsite 
Daily work : The day to day work usually feel very meaningful and connected to the player experience on most team , albeit slow and often inefficient 
Location in Santa Monica , vicinity to nice lunch spot , hype about the co 
I enjoy the other people that I work with a they know what they are doing and I do n't have to watch over them 24/7 
`` At Riot , though , it seems like many people are actually friend outside of work and there is definitely an atmosphere which invite you to get to know your coworkers really personally 
I can trust fellow Rioters to do their best and I can trust Riot to do right by me 
Freedom to work on numerous project 
Flexible hour 
Work / Life balance : Riot Games is filled with passionate people who deeply care about what they do and feel committed to delivering player value 
After about one year with Riot , I learned how to manage my Work / Life balance better 
Now , my line of work doesn ’ t demand weekend work for example 
Riot is big now ; multiple function demand different work schedule , overtime , and commitment from Rioters 
You wo n't want to go home 
do n't feel like i have to babysit people or be held accountable for others ' incompetence 
get to play game at work ! 
Very comfortable and amicable work environment , if you 're of our kin 
Playing League in between work is commonplace , twitch 
A bunch of productive nerd running around trying to make cool stuff for other gamers 
Freedom found everywhere from the work you do , when/how you do it , and scheduling 
Gaming at work is normal 
There is ample opportunity to work on project you feel passionate about while managing your own time 
The inane pressure placed upon employee of publicly traded company simply do n't exist at Riot 
Open PTO and most team have focus on health and sustainability ( although some individual team can have bad balance at time ) 
Outside of my technical duty , I 've gotten involved in the community with Riot 
I 've had chance to attend conference and seminar ( GDC , E3 , local entrepreneurship event ) , work on a couple internal `` level up '' initiative , participate in collegiate event , attend hackathons , and work on some PR idea 
There is a lot of intellectual desire to be good about work/life balance , but people do get caught up in the presumed importance of what they are doing and forget not to crunch 
Sometimes crunch is even necessary but I 've never been on a team where this wa true for extended period of time 
In short , Riot want to have good work life balance and the tool are given to everyone to achieve that , but most of u fail to achieve it 
I 'm a hard working individual that love to invest myself into my work , but if life happens ( and it will happen ) I love that Riot step up and help me take care of it 
You need to move ? Talk to your team , make sure your work is taken care off , and take time off to move 
Or you 're struck by sickness ? Go home , let it heal , come back and do n't get everyone else sick ( yay , for not getting people sick ) 
d ) Working from home is ok 
Since I have a lot of interaction with other artist I need to be in the office a lot , but in general it 's ok to take 1 day out of 2 week and work from home 
This benefit me and other Rioters greatly a it keep morale high and allows for some concentrated time working at home a well 
there 's literally too much to do outside of work that Riot take care off 
I do n't want to be a pencil pusher that clock in at 9am and ca n't wait for 5pm to hit 
Rioters work hard , they love to play game and laugh , and they love to create awesome stuff 
at least on the art side ) of hard work and going home 
If you love game , like to work , love to create and want to have amazing other artist around this is a fantastic place to be at 
My favorite part about working here is the autonomy you get 
The employee there eat , live and breathe the game , and it 'll offset some of the rougher part of working there 
Some of the department are killing it , and , if you work in one of these , then Riot life up to being a Great Place to Work 
All conversation are on the table across the company , politics exist a they do with all social system , however Riot ha done a amazing job of finding a healthy balance 
I have found Riot to strive for a good work life balance 
I have worked on a weeked twice ( aside from checking email on my phone ) over two year 
Longer day are not uncommon however although only once ha that ever been explicit asked of me ( there wa a problem with the live service and I wa happy to help ) 
Work can be chaotic and there 's not always someone telling you what to do 
Life come first , and if I have an emergency or something I need to take care of , I never feel pressured to put Riot or my work first 
Work-life balance varies from team to team 
My team ha a great balance of core hour and productivity , and our schedule are flexible to accommodate family and other commitment 
As long a you continue to deliver on commitment , no one is going to tell you to work until 9:30pm 
However , it is not ( in my experience ) a particularly cutthroat work environment 
Involvement on passion project is encouraged , in supplement to your core responsibility 
I love the fact that it 's a challenging collaborative environment and people are incredibly down to earth & friendly 
Highly intelligent , result oriented and generally fun to be around describes almost everyone I work with day to day 
Many employee eat , sleep , and breathe League of Legends or other PC game , and the `` player perspective '' that Riot ha a a result of this truly allows u to connect with our player ( customer ) on the deepest level 
There 's no shortage of work to be done , and if you 're a go-getter , you can rise quickly at Riot if you 're delivering result and solving perceived problem in way that add player value 
This is a place where you can both be your professional self and your personal self 
great work space with good desk , chair and computer 
Flexible schedule The hour are flexible , which is awesome 
No one is actively babysitting you ( unlike much of the corporate world these day ) 
Feel free to shuffle your hour around a long a you make all of your ( MANY ) meeting , which in practice put a damper on that flexibility 
Better stay a couple hour late , so you have time to actually do the work we talked about in all those meeting 
Play League of Legends at work You should , because you 'll need some kind of stress relief from the insanity , if you can squeeze a game in between meeting 
If your work schedule doe n't match up to your neighbor ' prepare for constant distraction a they shout profanity at each other across the room 
I love coming into work everyday because I know that my hard work go to making the player experience better 
Very comfortable working environment 
Excellent work-life balance , and a friendly , equal opportunity atmosphere 
The campus amenity are simply nut ; they take very good care of me while I 'm at work 
I 've never been asked to stay late , come in early , or work weekend 
The liberty to work on project you care deeply about 
This is the land of chill if you just do your job , which is n't a bad thing for most people 
Most Rioters are cool and fun people to work and hang out with 
This is n't a 9-5 corporate job for sure 
If you like to play game and work a lot , you 'll love the office 
Lots of people play game and work most of the day , eating every meal at the office 
Riot care about it employee , and try to make sure people take time off / take care of their body / etc 
Company care > > Riot go above and beyond to make the work life a comfortable a possible for Rioters 
Literally , every company I 've worked for ha been so concerned with managing the bottom line it adversely affect the employee ( and player/customer ) 
Wonderful people operation department that make your daily routine remarkably pleasant 
Riot really take care of it people and ha a great interest in making sure everyone feel part of the work that go on 
Also , a long a I notified them of work going into OT , it wa n't a big problem and for a single person like me , I did n't mind grinding a few extra hour for a time and a half 
We even had a townhall every other Friday where we drank beer and watched presentation about new stuff for League and checked in on all area of the company 
Most people have a familiarity with the game and you can tell that they genuinely enjoy working at the company 
Anything I needed for a particular project , I could send a request to IT and get it relatively soon 
The space we work in now is incredible , and the people who work to make sure we have a great place to work probably deserve even more praise than I can give them 
Flexible Work Hours 
Lots of extracurricular activity 
Great positive energy around the office where people come to work because they WANT to 
Flexible work schedule 
I feel like the work I do matter and is cared about 
Empowerment and growth : Since coming to Riot , and for the first time in my 11 year career , I feel like I can bring my whole self to work 
if you need an ultra regimented or structured environment , Riot ’ s not for you 
Work/life balance : I used to be in the camp that felt that Rioter work/life balance wa really bad , and that Riot need to step in to manage/coach u better at this 
Over the past year I had a lot of personal obligation come up that required me to take time off , sometimes at inconvenient time 
It ’ s true that Rioters spend a lot of time at work , but we ’ re also responsible for finding the sustainable balance that ’ s right for u 
The office space and extra curricular activity are great if you are young/single 
Working at a game company and playing sometimes during the day is great 
However , it is not ( in my experience ) a particularly cutthroat work environment 
My favorite part about working here is the autonomy you get 
but I 've been here over a year and never had any of that pressure 
Most people work typical 9-5ish schedule and everyone here seems to have a great work/life balance 
People that do decide to work late do so because they are excited about what they are making progress on 
Flexible Time off is great , use it 
Participate in all the social club , spend time at the office or with your office pal , learn Kickboxing , do Yoga , learn to swing dance , go our drinking , go to the gym , etc etc etc 
Be sure to also find out which group require you to work unacceptable hour and just avoid them unless you are a masochist 
Work can be chaotic and there 's not always someone telling you what to do 
Life come first , and if I have an emergency or something I need to take care of , I never feel pressured to put Riot or my work first 
Work-life balance varies from team to team

Longer day are not uncommon however although only once ha that ever been explicit asked of me ( there wa a problem with the live service and I wa happy to help ) 
You 'll be given the freedom of an adult and thus control your schedule completely , but also be expected to perform your job 
Lots of freedom 
Many employee eat , sleep , and breathe League of Legends or other PC game , and the `` player perspective '' that Riot ha a a result of this truly allows u to connect with our player ( customer ) on the deepest level 
There 's no shortage of work to be done , and if you 're a go-getter , you can rise quickly at Riot if you 're delivering result and solving perceived problem in way that add player value 
I 'm consistently challenged but do n't feel overwhelmed 
I look forward to coming to work and being around talented , passionate people 
Work is full of the good feel everyday 
Freedom to work on numerous project 
Flexible hour 
Flexible schedule The hour are flexible , which is awesome

If your work schedule doe n't match up to your neighbor ' prepare for constant distraction a they shout profanity at each other across the room 
To offset the incredible availability of free calorie , there are dozen of sport and exercise group that meet up after work 
Oh , also , you have `` discretionary '' time off , so a long a you do n't go crazy , your vacation day are up to you 
Work-life balance : Honestly , pretty good 
I know many people who work late or sometimes come in on the weekend , but it 's by no mean expected or required 
I leave around 7 PM every day and try to never come in on the weekend 
That said , to learn and grow at the rate the company expects , I do sometimes feel that I need to use my free time to study and learn new technique 
I 'm a hard working individual that love to invest myself into my work , but if life happens ( and it will happen ) I love that Riot step up and help me take care of it 
You need to move ? Talk to your team , make sure your work is taken care off , and take time off to move

The work environment is friendly and chilled out but at the same time you are expected to deliver 
You are likely to work hard but you will also play lot of LoL throughout the week 
The company genuinely care , Riot ’ s fully vested not only my career but my life 
No HQ v local office 
Working on the best game in the world : this is probably bias because I 've been playing / loving LOL since Season 1 but helping Riot making LOL even better is a honour for me

 Where I was used to making decisions before, I always still presented my decision to my MD for final approval or blessing

Where I wa used to making decision before , I always still presented my decision to my MD for final approval or blessing 
Leadership , starting with the CEO , have ambitious vision for the future , and practical idea of how to get there 
This is accounting for a full career in leadership and management role spanning 20+ year , 10 of which have been in the game industry working for the most recognized name in gaming 
The senior management is very open , transparent , available and above all `` gamers like u '' 
There have been several time where I have an idea , bounce it off my team lead and ( if needed ) exec leadership , and then they let me run with it 
Senior leadership 
I usually agree with our senior leadership 
Senior leadership at Riot is invigorated to help solve some of the `` growing pain '' and well a existing problem s 
Senior Leadership : Riot senior leadership is very transparent with our high level goal and most of our longer term milestone to get there 
Senior management truly make an effort to listen to the employee a we continue to grow 
Senior Management : The leadership team is stacked with some of the smartest people I ’ ve ever met 
The president and CEO have the same size desk a everyone else and sit amongst developer and producer 
Leadership often default to trust when it come to the Rioters that work for them 
At Riot , game are sr business 
Great leadership team 
A large portion of Riot 's senior leadership is focused on how to make sure Riot 's culture remains intact a the organization continues to grow globally 
Most senior leader I 've observed that were n't external hire were folk who identified a problem space they cared about passionately , were able to rally others around around it , and ended up proposing and creating the team/department from wholecloth 
Visionary executive leadership that invests heavily in area of pioneering expansion 
( + ) CEOs 
+ Marc and Brandon ( the founder ) are legitimate gamers and great leader that genuinely care about the experience Riot delivers to player 
Great leadership team 
At Riot , game are sr business 
Most manager are former engineer 
Most Rioters ( even senior leadership ! ) do n't take themselves too seriously and being in the same room with CEO/President is not intimidating at all 
This is accounting for a full career in leadership and management role spanning 20+ year , 10 of which have been in the game industry working for the most recognized name in gaming 
great team all the tool to be successful strong partnership from the HMs the company seems to appreciate recruiting 
There are manager who genuinely care and also provide great mentorship , but once you get to a senior leadership level , both that mentorship and the Learning Development program for middle management ( and up ) are severely lacking 
Leadership at Riot is entrenched 
Leadership of Gamers : I 've been around the industry and most senior executive do n't even play the game they worked on and made major decision for 
At Riot , you 're an outsider if you do n't play a bunch of game ( Marc & Brandon the founder , Nicolo , the CEO , Scott the CTO are all big gamers ) 
The new leadership at the C-Level realizes that League and the R & D title no longer have that luxury , and are making hard choice on prioritization 
[LISTSEP]
Very talented people work there
 Amazing job culture 
 Talents 
 If you like to work in a Start-up environment where we need to find out things on our way, this will be the right environment for you
 So if you like to work in a start up environment this is the right place for you
 High quality hiring
When looking to leave my last job, for about 12 months I explored numerous opportunities at various MNC's and Financial Institutions, always leaving the interviews a bit disheartened by the lack of emphasis that was put on Talent
 Riot views its Talent (aka Rioters) as its number 1 resource
This is a great place to work
 Rioters are truly given the autonomy and tools to craft their career and level up the experience for players
 You are responsible for your own work flow and career development and if you take the opportunity to shine then you will succeed
 For me personally, working at Riot is my dream job
 This should excite you into wanting to level up and be a part of that
 I have learnt more working at Riot in less than a year than I did in 3 years at my previous role
 If you are driven, smart, and you rock, there are tons of career opportunities in Riot worldwide 
 So much talent and passionate people to work with
 And while this policy is in place, employees feel more empowered to work on the projects they love, instead of being limited to a certain job forever
I have been with Riot in Sydney for under a year
 The role is bigger than your job
 This means in whatever job you have in riot you can have impact
 The hiring bar is high and continually rising
 You will understand it during long interview process
 If you also consider yourself more of an entrepreneur, helping building the studio in Hong Kong will be a blast
 I've seen so many good people enter as lower skilled jobs as hourly, and really grow and contribute into promoted roles, often cross-department
 If you're dedicated and passionate, Riot is a great company
 Your opportunities at Riot are not as limited by hierarchy or bureaucracy, it's really a place where, if you perform, you will be able to take on more responsibilities and leadership roles
 The things you work on and the role you have with the company grows as you do
 If you want to kick down doors and take on more responsibility you will be given the chance to do so
 I still walk across the Pyrmont bridge going 'wow I get to work at Riot games today'
I have been working at Riot Games São Paulo Office for more than one year as a Rioter (it is a fact that I used to be a contractor for more than 2 and a half years for Recruiting)
Coming back to write another review because of role change
 Previously executive assistant, current in product management for the "back office", I am grateful that such change is possible, and so I can stay motivated and further focus on the things I am passionate about
Career opportunities and do what i love
 I have never in my career in leadership and management roles been so completely empowered
 Personal/Professional Growth Opportunities 
 Leveling up is an integral part of being a Rioter
 There is a constant stream of educational and development opportunities through a variety of channels, and if there is something unique that you want to do that will help level up both you and Riot (even sometimes not directly related to your current role), there is support for that as well
 As an example, I recently wanted to take an academic accreditation in a specific methodology for leadership, management, and communications
 that should tell you something about how Riot operates and looks at professional growth
 I joined few months before the game launched, traveled and helped set up multiples offices and I now work in the Hong Kong office
 in most companies, a foreign office job is to basically execute in the local country whatever the head office has decided
 Your scope / impact might be more limited than in HQ (although China is a pretty big market), but you’ll have full ownership of whatever project you work on
One of the best place to be in the industry atm
 Passion: again, being gamers is almost everybody's dream to work for a gaming company
 Opportunities: I started in the EU office and for personal reason I couldn't work there any more and I was offered the opportunity to work in the Australian office
The interview process at Riot is long and hard (yes this turns into a pro)
 The recruiter who handled my case was honest about this from the outset, extremely responsive and kept me in the loop
 However even with all this it was at times frustrating, BUT within 24 hours of starting my first day it became obvious why the hiring process is what it is
Very talented people work there
 Amazing job culture

 If you like to work in a Start-up environment where we need to find out things on our way, this will be the right environment for you

When looking to leave my last job, for about 12 months I explored numerous opportunities at various MNC's and Financial Institutions, always leaving the interviews a bit disheartened by the lack of emphasis that was put on Talent
 Riot views its Talent (aka Rioters) as its number 1 resource
This is a great place to work
 Rioters are truly given the autonomy and tools to craft their career and level up the experience for players
 You are responsible for your own work flow and career development and if you take the opportunity to shine then you will succeed
 For me personally, working at Riot is my dream job
 This should excite you into wanting to level up and be a part of that
 I have learnt more working at Riot in less than a year than I did in 3 years at my previous role
 If you are driven, smart, and you rock, there are tons of career opportunities in Riot worldwide 
 So much talent and passionate people to work with
 And while this policy is in place, employees feel more empowered to work on the projects they love, instead of being limited to a certain job forever
I have been with Riot in Sydney for under a year
 The role is bigger than your job
 This means in whatever job you have in riot you can have impact
 The hiring bar is high and continually rising
 You will understand it during long interview process
 If you also consider yourself more of an entrepreneur, helping building the studio in Hong Kong will be a blast
 I've seen so many good people enter as lower skilled jobs as hourly, and really grow and contribute into promoted roles, often cross-department
 If you're dedicated and passionate, Riot is a great company
 Your opportunities at Riot are not as limited by hierarchy or bureaucracy, it's really a place where, if you perform, you will be able to take on more responsibilities and leadership roles
 The things you work on and the role you have with the company grows as you do
 If you want to kick down doors and take on more responsibility you will be given the chance to do so
 I still walk across the Pyrmont bridge going 'wow I get to work at Riot games today'
I have been working at Riot Games São Paulo Office for more than one year as a Rioter (it is a fact that I used to be a contractor for more than 2 and a half years for Recruiting)
Coming back to write another review because of role change
 Previously executive assistant, current in product management for the "back office", I am grateful that such change is possible, and so I can stay motivated and further focus on the things I am passionate about

Career opportunity and do what i love 
I have never in my career in leadership and management role been so completely empowered 
Personal/Professional Growth Opportunities 
Leveling up is an integral part of being a Rioter 
As an example , I recently wanted to take an academic accreditation in a specific methodology for leadership , management , and communication 
that should tell you something about how Riot operates and look at professional growth 
I joined few month before the game launched , traveled and helped set up multiple office and I now work in the Hong Kong office 
in most company , a foreign office job is to basically execute in the local country whatever the head office ha decided 
Your scope / impact might be more limited than in HQ ( although China is a pretty big market ) , but you ’ ll have full ownership of whatever project you work on 
One of the best place to be in the industry atm 
Passion : again , being gamers is almost everybody 's dream to work for a gaming company 
Opportunities : I started in the EU office and for personal reason I could n't work there any more and I wa offered the opportunity to work in the Australian office 
The interview process at Riot is long and hard ( yes this turn into a pro ) 
The recruiter who handled my case wa honest about this from the outset , extremely responsive and kept me in the loop 
Before Sydney , Riot gave me the opportunity to work for the European Office and in the Santa Monica Office 
There are plenty of opportunity to grow in so many direction ( horizontally , vertically and internationally ) and I 'm the living example 
Plenty of room for advancement 
If I have a skill and it can be used in a valuable way for the company , it get nurtured 
We also have ton of internals event , speaker series , food-fueled meeting , beer-powered Show & Tells , etc 
I pretty much tell all my friend about looking for way to join 
So much more than `` just a game company '' , you 'll likely learn more here in a few year than a decade at any other company 
Learning is highly emphasized , including through many on-site class that are truly excellent and help me improve in my day to day work a well a thing I could take into my next career 
Generally , the closer you get to game development the better off you 'll be

Great experience working for a young company with money to throw at interesting project

Great work environment 
The type of people that made you want to go into the office everyday 
Solid company to work for 
Lots of room for growth and great manager 
Great work environment 
I knew working at a video game company would probably be fun , but I expected a lot of thing to be more immature and short-sighted than how they actually are here 
Personal development is also important , and you have the opportunity to grow and change role if that 's what make the most sense for you 
Riot , however , empowers many junior Rioters to jump in the deep end and own a product 
I get to have an impact on million of player , how cool is that ?

And if you work hard and look for way to contribute in a big , meaningful way , you 'll be rewarded with career growth opportunity 
I 'm still amazed at how much Riot invests in the development and advancement of Rioters 
I 've been involved in a few start-ups in my life ; I like having the chance to work in fast paced environment , having input into technical and business decision , and not feeling like a suit is directing my movement 
None of these thing are in my job title , but I 'm interested in it so the sky is the limit 
If you are tenacious , honest and talented there is a ton of room for career growth , even in the company 's post start-up phase 
There 's a very entrepreneurial vibe here 
I 've been with the company close to 5 year all the way from them being a le than 40 people company up to now more than 1,000 Rioters and while I had multiple ( lucrative ) offer to leave this is the right place for me to be at 
Riot is extremely competitive Work with some of the best in the industry , developing friendship that last for decade The work is fun , intellectually stimulating and challenging Coworkers and management often support and advise you Constantly push people who are n't adapting well to grow or move on Learned more here from people who challenged me to grow than anywhere else I 've been We had several area where I needed to improve significantly to fill the role the company needed and Riot did a lot to provide resource to grow 
Riot is definitely one of the most dynamic environment I 've experienced in my career 
Riot put a serious and genuine emphasis on both professional and personal growth 
On top of the L & D course they offer , Riot 's packed full of some of the smartest industry professional out there 
If you love League , you 'll probably have the time of your life at Riot 
`` Land in one of the weaker department and you 'll probably default to coasting , realizing it 's not a bad choice for a consistent pay check 
I have worked at two other triple A game developer 
* Tons of growth opportunity 
Riot hire for people , not position , so they will help you to heavily invest in your future , even if that 's in a different position than the one you hired into

If you want to work on truly cutting-edge technology in gaming then this is the place to be , and it only going to get better 
I 've been working at Riot Games in multiple team , during that time I 've improved programming and teamwork aspect I wa n't even aware of 
I feel that the talent around doe match with any world class company like Google or Netflix 
year of experience is not a key determining factor in how we hire or operate 
Huge opportunity for growth 
Junior employee are offered more and more responsibility based on performance and aptitude 
Management definitely value your work at Riot over any previous experience 
I 've been here for quite some time now and have seen people get hired in at very junior-level position rise to management and product owner role by identifying problem and working their butt off to solve them 
Riot is an awesome place for people passionate about game and hungry to achieve more in their craft 
I came into Riot ready to prove myself beyond the skill my resume implied 
As a result , I 've steadily taken on new and greater responsibility and really built a career here at Riot 
I really ca n't imagine a better place to work in game ( or in tech around the greater LA area ) 
finance or recruiting ) are passionate gamers 
Some Riot time might look good on a resume because of our reach , but do n't plan on Riot being good for your portfolio , or your confidence 
Growth opportunity 
Solid talent in engineering , game design , and art 
We 've generally done an excellent job at hiring both experienced people with a passion for knowledge sharing and people just starting their career but with a high aptitude for learning and execution 
Despite the game now approaching 5 year of age , the product still ha ton of opportunity for marketer and community manager to re-imagine how we do thing and go bigger 
Riot is highly invested in hiring good talent , and helping staff grow 
The opportunity for growth are abundant 
This ha some interesting manifestation a it come to hiring and career growth 
I have witnessed any number of amazing engineer either be passed over a a hire or leave the company because at the end of the day they valued building awesome technology more than they valued how that technology wa creating better experience for the player 
Promotion and career progression are disconnected from how `` hard '' one work , who they know , or one 's particular work quality ( unless that quality is sub-par ) 
Thus , longevity or delivery on mere quantity of feature doe n't play well for advancement 
Waiting for a new department to have an open leadership slot is not very effective 
League of Legends is a cool product to work on 
Lots of top notch engineer 
Lot of very passionate , skilled people to work with 
Opportunity to work on a high profile , popular title with a strong esports/competitive scene 
Riot Games is an amazing place to work for

There is a lot of autonomy when it come to your job , and if you like that , and are good at it , then you will succeed 
Important takeaway for those that want to work there : if you do n't play the game ( League of Legends ) , you best sign-up and start playing before even thinking about applying for a position 
Plenty of opportunity for moving around the company , lot of room to grow within role , really cool work-space , great benefit

The only thing that limit your professional growth is the pace at which you can learn to be what you want to be next 
In a way , when you enter Riot Games , you are the entrepreneur of your own success and of the company 's success 
I had very bad feedback from a team , and instead of just putting the blame on me , my career mentor took the time to investigate and get deeper within the problem , which ended up by giving mutual feedback in both direction in a constructive way 
To that end , you have a level of control over your career at Riot that I 've not experienced anywhere else

[LISTSEP]
 Perks and the environment are good too
 Salaries are good and benefits above market
 Company Perks 
 Good benefit, game time, unlimited holiday 
 Aside from the benefits like unlimited holidays, flexible hours, top of the market health plan, free snacks/fruit etc
 You are hired as an expert in your respective discipline, and treated as such
 The perks are also pretty crazy, but if that's the reason you're coming on board then I would do some soul-searching first
 good product -location can't be beaten -decent pay
 Great intentions, open feedback, lots of perks
 Pros ——— The great thing about living in Hong Kong; convenient and practical city, easy commute, easy travel in Asia, affordable cost of living (food, entertainment, travel), great healthcare, top international schools, great for expats, low taxes, etc…
 Riot also cares about the Rioters who work here, and while the perks aren't overly extravagant in Hong Kong, such as smoothies on Tuesdays and massages on Thursdays, they are nice little reminders that Riot appreciates our hard work
 There's also perks like free food (breakfast on Tues/Thurs, Lunch on Weds), half price gym, free healthcare, great office space, travel, swag, etc, but to me they are icing on the cake
 The best review on the perks and the talent (HR) team here is the company will always support you in whatever you are trying to do 
 you really do get taken care of well
 Very nice perks and swags; 
 Awesome special events (massage, afternoon coffee break, team outings for team building, Riot Rumble!); 
 Willing to try different methods to attract talent (subsidise gym, fruits/cereals/snacks always available for staff, unlimited annual leave etc) 
 We hold internal tournaments, have catered breakfasts twice a week and a catered lunch once a week
 This brings pros and cons
Talented and motivated people Lots of Perks and stuff Travel travel travel Amazing development opportunities

 Company Perks 
 Good benefit, game time, unlimited holiday 
 Aside from the benefits like unlimited holidays, flexible hours, top of the market health plan, free snacks/fruit etc

 The perks are also pretty crazy, but if that's the reason you're coming on board then I would do some soul-searching first
 good product -location can't be beaten -decent pay
 Great intentions, open feedback, lots of perks
 Pros ——— The great thing about living in Hong Kong; convenient and practical city, easy commute, easy travel in Asia, affordable cost of living (food, entertainment, travel), great healthcare, top international schools, great for expats, low taxes, etc…
 Riot also cares about the Rioters who work here, and while the perks aren't overly extravagant in Hong Kong, such as smoothies on Tuesdays and massages on Thursdays, they are nice little reminders that Riot appreciates our hard work
 There's also perks like free food (breakfast on Tues/Thurs, Lunch on Weds), half price gym, free healthcare, great office space, travel, swag, etc, but to me they are icing on the cake
 The best review on the perks and the talent (HR) team here is the company will always support you in whatever you are trying to do 
 you really do get taken care of well
 Very nice perks and swags; 
 Awesome special events (massage, afternoon coffee break, team outings for team building, Riot Rumble!);

When people struggle they are given help to perform better 
+ Perks and salary are good 
Saw some negative review about salary , which I 'm surprised by 
It also feel like the `` people '' team ( HR/recruiting ) constantly are looking for way to make thing better , like extending gym benefit to spouse or getting u a 401k , etc 
Super benefit

Compensation 
Speaking for my job anyway , compensation is top of the market 
Perks 
Comp/benefits package ahead of the industry and facilities/perks are amazing 
You wo n't go hungry here , and can always find someone who ha played some obscure title you think only you 've played 
Free stuff everywhere ( food , swag , etc )

Perks , I guess 
There are some pretty nice one , free food , great campus , fitness class 
Compensation & Benefits : In my experience , the Compensation is according to the market standard 
For example , Engineering is a high priority area for Riot , so it ’ s reflected in compensation 
Of course , you can ’ t disconnect compensation from the cost of living 
The benefit outside of salary are numerous and include standard thing like private health care , dental care , eye care , free food , and snack but also numerous not so usual benefit such a travel allowance , gaming allowance and gym subsidizing 
To me , this is the biggest benefit of being part of Riot 
The campus is beautiful , they feed you lunch/dinner , and there is booze 
Open PTO policy 
No need to feel bad about taking PTO for sick day !

The company reward risk taker that deliver awesome experience for our player 
Benefits of working there are outrageous 
Almost too many benefit to keep track of 
Perks are also enormous , and nearly endless 
Wonderful food and amenity 
great perk , including health benefit , good dental , and vision -free lunch in the cafeteria , free dinner if you work past 8pm -free snack and drink all over campus -beautiful solo campus -great security ( sometimes it too overprotective and make for a huge bottleneck at event ) -awesome , brilliant , hardworking people -dedication to art and engineering is unprecedented -20/80 woman : men ratio , which is higher than most place , and the woman are often very tight-knit with event and stuff , though some can be quite cliquey 
Food , comfy salary , good time off policy , project look exciting at first 
You 're provided anything you need 
Lots of free amenity 
Unlimited vacation and sick day ( with manager approval ) 
On campus perk and benefit are top notch , and it 's a place for those who are willing to pick their project ( class ) , team member ( partner ) , and work ( major ) 
BENEFITS : Awesome healthcare and pay benefit

Popular IP with great opportunity to expand -Quality of life perk : free lunch on Tuesdays , dinner stipend , unlimited PTO ( though you may never feel able to use it ) -Amazing art team and some highly creative individual -Annual company retreat ( although some employee have to stay behind ) -Diverse group of people 
There is an open PTO policy and I am constantly encouraged to take more advantage of it

A recent test of this wa when there wa a change in payroll that wa announced ahead of time , elicited a ton of negative feedback and wa promptly cancelled because of the feedback 
The perk and benefit offered to Riot and our S/Os is leap and bound better then I 've ever experienced anywhere 
Things like unlimited PTO , on campus lunch & dinner , annual stipend to buy game , and so much more make Riot an incredible place to work 
The perk are standard tech company , including open PTO , fully-subsidized meal , and flexible work hour 
* Great salary range for senior level employee 
* Nice office , good kitchen with free food 
PTO is second to none 
* Incredible perk , from ton of swag and free food to subsidized gym membership and healthcare benefit 
Pay is competitive ( in my experience ) , but I have seen some pay complaint while looking through other review , so draw your own conclusion 
As long a you give your work 100 % , Riot will give back to you , and be completely understanding if you need to work from home or need time for your family 
Stability , let 's face it in game knowing you have a paycheck to come home to grant peace of mind 
The campus amenity like coffee and free lunch are a nice perk 
* Amazing Talent * Innovative view on how to serve player * Great pay * Interesting problem to solve * Direct relationship to player * Passion throughout the entire company 
Talented and smart people You 're given direction and ownership with little oversight Lots of perk : unlimited PTO , free food , great campus Very player focused : employee are encouraged to talk to and interact with player Great feedback culture 
The other perk ( dinner when working late , beer during big presentation , party , offsite trip , lot of swag and internal game tournament ) only deepen my desire to spend time at the office 
quality coffee and pastry I 'm not going to list everything , but on top of the previously mentioned perk , two team make a huge difference for everyone at Riot : IT and Facility team 
Riot treat all of it employee incredibly well , from top tier benefit across the board , to the state of the art campus , free gourmet lunch and dinner 
-Riot care about it 's player -Flexible work hour -Free dinner ! -Everyone is good at what they do here , excellence is expected -Good compensation -Makes a great game -Everyone LOVES game 
Again , super cool benefit but kind of hampered by the reality of Riot life 
Lots of free food Remember the freshman 15 ? Try the Riot 20 ! This is how Riot show it 's love 
Catered meeting and presentation , late night dinner subsidy , adult beverage at company wide event 
Benefits This is one of the few area where Riot shine 
Primarily because it is easy to throw a chunk of money at the people team and there 's not a lot of politics involved 
If your SO doe n't have their own coverage , Riot will subsidize them a if they are an employee , which is a very nice gesture and is probably very useful to some Rioters 
401k match is decent too 
Really fun and impactful work , great benefit , great office environment with outstanding amenity 
Lots of nice Quality of Life thing , free food , free coffee , very nice overall in term of person to person interaction 
Employees are cared for 
There 's other perk : very competitive salary , free dinner , class , great equipment , playing game at work , but at the end of the day , the best part about working at Riot is that you 'll be working with great people and you 'll be rewarded if you 're willing to take risk 
`` Fun '' environment , where people get to shoot each other with nerf gun , you get to play the game and see new item before they are release , and a bunch of company perk 
Unlimited PTO 
What I work on is largely up to me -- if I take initiative in my interest , I am rewarded 
I see a clear pathway to follow at Riot , where I can be rewarded with all the skill and experience I want 
Cool perk 
If you want a comfortable life , good pay for developer standard , free food , and playing video game at work , then this is the place to be

Benefits are pretty darn good 
both in the form of standard benefit ( health insurance , 401k matching , etc ) and in the form of le standard perk ( the new office occasionally feel like nerd Disneyland ) 
Although people complain about it , the comp and benefit package is ridiculous given the company 's standing 
Fantastic campus and perk 
Once you step on the Riot HQ property , everything is free including gourmet meal , well stocked kitchen and a full service coffee shop and smoothie bar 
Good place to learn for those very early on in their career Aspirations and goal that can inspire and motivate people Free food Good friend Decent compensation League of Legends and the gaming community around it ha left me with very fond memory and close friendship
