They give lip service to diversity , but without cleaning house of the misogynist in leadership , nothing will ever change 
some were too idiosyncratic to get along with the others but mostly everyone like everyone else 
The diversity and employee engagement initiative are half-baked and the HQ energy is horribly depressing for a gaming company 
It 's not a highly diverse company , and the time for that is over 
Many event will be `` planned '' and then cancelled which is n't necessarily anyone 's fault but it prof that diversity and accepting those who are different really is n't a top priority 
some equity issue during company 
[LISTSEP]
Lack of any company culture 
High expectation and goal for all team 
Not a place for latest and greatest tech stack 
Their management need to treat their worker like actual people not a stat to keep cost down so Robert Kotick and Dennis Derkin can get another multimillion dollar bonus 
It used to be a company that emphasized having fun and keeping employee engaged 
And remember respect is not deserved it earned 
Check yourself and your attitude at the door no one want to hear it 
They treat every employee a a number and completely replaceable 
A culture of Us and Them 
It is a misogynistic environment 
Totally chaotic , back-stabbing culture 
It is also hard to get a sense of where you stand against your peer a it is not a very transparent organization in term of what is expected of you 
not for everyone Executives do n't always live the company value Very bottom line driven ( but what for-profit company is n't ? ) 
Management ha no clue what they are doing a far a relating to their employee or customer , it 's a typical TAKE the money out of their pocket instead of make awesome product and shut up and let them give their money freely 
Terrible `` end justifies the mean '' culture 
Woman treated a second class citizen 
It 's cloaked under the perception that they are `` high achiever '' a opposed to them really just being tribal and willing to put others down to get ahead 
High turnover due to this and the culture 
Below that , stay away 
should not be someone who want the position to earn more money , it should be someone who love the department they are in and want nothing more than for everyone in the team to succeed 
Be social , go out with the right people when they invite you out , etc 
Management ha no care or respect for employee 
Mindset is to push box out the door with no care , regard , or knowledge of what is even being sold at time 
This is good and bad , since it retains each studio 's culture but allows for difference in quality , both in term of developed content and the proficiency of manager 
The employee network are unfortunately lip service to please shareholder 
the way the company really work is that if a client ha an issue with one of the game , and they want to make a complaint , they ca n't really contact u 
The studio side is very misogynistic & old school 
Money is not ok , no free food and very quiet period during winter 
Extremely hierarchical culture 
Most conservative culture in the industry 
Lack long-term vision/mission 
Harassment & Discrimination should be apart of the value a they do it so well 
Culture is horrible 
Aggressive policy Lack of sharing the vision 
20 % of the headcount drive 80 % of the value 
Activision culture is horrible 
centralised thinking is dominant 
Do n't give up ! It 'll get better soon 
Fear culture 
American-centric approach to market engagement 
Corporate culture is stiff and impersonal at the best of time , and openly hostile at the worst of time 
This is not so much of a downside because the company take the work and word of each member seriously 
The atmosphere really is a kill or be killed mentality 
Ruthless ! 
Acitivision 's entire business plan involves miking their franchise for all they are worth until they run them into the ground 
Minimal care for technology , many folk who prefer an antiquated way of running studio , little growth for some folk 
Culture in Activision office wa just a toxic a it would seem from the outside 
Shaming female employee and forcing them to drink 
Bullying culture , pretty near total lack of humanity on the whole ( but many pocket of entirely good people stuck in untenable circumstance ) 
Founder-led company Only a few making decision Bad behavior rewarded in a select few bad apple 
No apparent care for employee well being or culture , HR are seemingly there to protect the company and shut down suggestion for improvement 
Great corporate culture in paper , poor corporate culture in real life 
Their word is the bible and shall not be questioned ! They hand out write-ups like it candy and tend to keep to the group of tenured people 
If you ever do you 're looked at with disgust and told to get back to work 
I have never been a part of an organization so utterly lacking in culture 
I know they appreciate the huge sacrifice employee make for the company , but could do a TON more to actually show it , like socializing with u more and offering more interaction and visibility ; also giving everyone access to a stock purchase program and not just handing out equity to the magical `` Directors and above '' cutoff 
My critique sound strong because I care about the place , a lot 
Its tough time so moral is pretty low because of the lay offs 
The people there are not friendly , they have a very stuck up attitude like if you 're beneath them 
Very corporate culture for a video game company 
The company culture is closer to movie production studio than real software tech company 
Very combative culture 
no transparency of brand/business objective 
Siloed mentality ; not strategic ; fear based culture

Too many hour 
Long work day 
You will be worked to the bone and be handed pity dollar 
Time management Functional watering dish Gospel 
Overtime working during the game launch 
You will go from working 40 hour a week to 60 a week frequently without warning 
It ’ s a lot of time 
No weekend or break 
We usually have a day off rotation that is assigned over three week , but recently we were punished for taking time off and not included in that rotation 
We should not have to depend on extreme overtime to afford a basic studio apartment 
Hard to maintain work life balence 
Abuse of worker , no respect for work/life balance 
No life , especially on the night shift 
if you work night during crunch you are forking 12 hour shift 6 night a week 
It instantly kill all social life you have outside of work 
This at first didnt seem like that big of an issue for me but all my relationship are falling apart because i get one day a week to see anyone or do anything unless i sacrifice my sleep 
Weekend work is required and often thrown on employee at the last minute 
Activision frequently required long hour with little notice 
Had to head to back school , wish I could have continued working there , wa super sad walking out my last day 
Work schedule get hectic 
Non-existent work/life balance 
A frequent amount of change in the daily task at hand , which can be hard to keep up for some 
But , Activision isn ’ t making change to make sure they survive , except yearly mass layoff which kill morale 
When it 's time to ship , you 'll have limited time with loved one 
Poor work life balance , uninspiring upper and mid management , no clear roadmap for the next 3 year , need to reinvent itself 
Poor work/life balance but this should be expected during crunch time

Work/life balance can be difficult , not a place I would recommend for anyone who want to be home by 6 to have dinner with the family every night 
There 's too much work at time 
Work life balance is hard to come by 
The ideal situation should be a balance between what 's needed from the employee for the company 's well-being , and some level of concern for employee development 
Work life balance , constant treadmill approach 
Difficult to maintain work life balance 
You have to do your own work 
Work/life balance is terrible 
This can be very demanding of introvert who just want to go in , do their job and anything else they are tasked with , but do n't really like going out for lunch or drink 
No work-life balance 
Too many temporary employee that can lack passion putting strain on other team member , recognition of professionalism and dedication is not given soon enough causing some stagnation , separation and disregard from `` full time qa '' toward their `` temp '' brother who can be working hard to separate themselves from the rest , strange attitude and strictness regarding breaks/lunch with little regard towards real-life emergency and issue 
Putting out a game every year ha turned into closer to a seven-month development cycle , but in the right studio you wo n't work weekend 
As a tester , the working condition are n't the most pleasant 
So sad it wa during pandemic and had to be working remotely 
They do n't enough , weekend work is not well prepared , there is no room for growth 
Working there also mean some month , you will be on shift and work several weekend in a row 
The work can be challenging at time , and repetitive at others 
The crunch is real 
When we are busy or when the game is gon na submit , it could be more overtime work 
Morning shift and Evening Shift is effective indeed but not so comfortable 
Forget about holiday on summer and two weekend per month , you will be very busy 
long hour , no over time , expected to work weekend and holiday a a matter of course 
No balance between personal & work life 
Shift work is required sometimes Management is not really efficient 
Expected work hour ranged around 80hrs a week 
You feel you are replaceable when you are co-worker leaf company after the busiest season ( summer ) 
shift is not friendly , ( finish at 8pm ) 
Can ’ t be too laid back 
Cut off business too quick 
Lots of crunch hour , expect to work weekend 
You will have to work overtime 
•Weekend work can be challenging •Crunch time 
Not too too much challenge 
Appalling work-life balance 
Overly lean organizational structure result in over-worked employee at every level , but particularly in the middle 
Work-life balance is non-existent ( 60-70 hour work week and interruption on holiday is the norm ) 
Working there also mean some month , you will be on shift and work several weekend in a row 
Like always in video game : lot of over time and project managment problem , But seems to be standard , i hear the same story all the time from all video game company 
No consideration for employee , long hour , tight schedule and deadline 
Work on weekend is not optional and very likely you will work 6 day a week without getting asked 
Not close to a well oiled machine 
Poor work-life balance 
Low wage , overtime and weekend shift 
Gaming company in general can require a lot of work time 
No peep no pay slave 
Random hour , low pay , long random shift 
Inequity , low pay , no work life balance 
Production team is somewhat micro-managing people 's working hour 
Manual over time so you 're looking at being forced to sit at a desk for 12 hour a day 
Horrible work-life balance 
Holidays are not guaranteed time off 
Work-life balance is pretty much nonexistent 
Schedule can change unexpectedly at time 
no work life balance 
Long hour : While the hour fluctuate throughout the year , the busy time are extremely busy with 10-12+ hour day and some time commitment on the weekend a well 
It 's a very fast-moving industry with a global presence , so it requires a big time commitment 
Long Hours and a lot of different task 
No work/life balance 
The club that are on campus are run by fellow employee but even that is a mess 
With the amount of work everyone ha on their plate , their last thought is on group 
If you work at Blizzard and want to live in Irvine , you 'll either need a lot of roommate to cover the bill or someone who is throwing out money to you 
Work/Life balance : LOL ! Oh and never ask to work from home ( Pre-COVID ) Current higher management is very anti-work from home 
There wa no work/life balance 
They take care of the people up top but are okay with turnover below 
We ALL work very hard here 
Bug quota 's can make play testing a chore 
Hard to get much breathing room for creative exploration 
Everyone work extremely hard and family balance is very difficult 
employee work hard , but are happy and having fun along the way ( hardly a con ? ) 
Stress can be high close to release time 
Workload can get out of hand at key time of year , it 's up to you to be sure to maintain balance and avoid burnout 
Taking call all day is mentally , emotionally and physically draining and the metric are always being tightened which mean `` more , more , more '' 
How do you maintain an entrepreneurial spirit while still running a large company ? 
Time and budgetary pressure add to a lot of stress 
the well-being of the team 
even if you work hard and make friend 
Not interested at all in culture or being a good place to work Soulless Poor work/life balance Will take advantage of you 
While a fun place to work due to the people , employee morale wa in the middle of the road due to product lack of success 
Project lead do n't know how to plan for overtime weekend 
So be ready to say no to OT unless you want to cancel your plan for two weekend a month 
Lots of overtime and it is n't always avoidable 
Our QA and LS team suffer more with the cost of living in Dublin 
Shifts no work life balance 
[LISTSEP]
Executive leadership is very disconnected from how thing are going ; initiative must be driven from the bottom up 
People are uptight , make one mistake and it 's held against you for a long time , senior leader are uncaring 
My manager is always talking about politics and vaccine and pushing his agenda on our team 
Even the CEO and other VPs send out company email and talk about the government/ vaccine in our town hall 
Big company politics , lot of hierarchy 
Low pay , even in senior/management position 
Chief Communication Officer is awful , even worse than the previous one 
The CEO is a joke 
Management supervisor were out of touch 
Titles are meaningless , multiple manager , director , and VPs have no one reporting to them 
Upper Management lack passion for gaming , or innovation in the industry 
Surprising level of immaturity and pessimism within executive and senior leadership 
Leadership speaks poorly of other employee inappropriately and publicly 
Executive decision making lean on the overly conservative side 
It ’ s no wonder the C-suite is dropping like fly 
They ’ re almost a year without a new CEO 
Even if not their job Very political for such a laid back environment Petty squabble never handled by flip-flop wearing management While foot soldier are very dedicated , upper management is not in touch with reality often within own team 
Top heavy management 
No opening for headcount at mid to junior level , however there will be a new SVP hired regularly 
No decision making ability until you are at a Director level or above 
Unless , you 're one of top mgt 's favorite 
Mgmt is out of touch , too many bad leader , right hand not sure what the left hand isdoing 
Little or no work/life balance unless you 're a director or above 
A manager/supervisor etc 
Low confidence in senior management 
Senior management and their ego 
How did some of these people get to where they are at anyway ? Senior management ha lost control of what 's really going on with the people who actually do the real work 
Questionable senior management decision 
No ESPP , no option grant for anyone below VP level 
Leadership is focused on revenue and not employee 
senior staff will ignore and shout at junior staff 
slow moving company overall because hierarchy 
Bullying and lying is riff among the senior management and much of the skilled workforce have left in the last few year a a result 
Heavily ego-driven executive in certain key function result in operational and commercial dysfunction 
Lack of leadership from the top down 
A|B ha had it struggle , largely in leadership communication and oversight 
Upper management is completely disconnected from it worker 
Women should n't work here a every male worker upto the uppermanagement and CEO are sexually harassing woman and keep on sweeping complaint under the rug 
HQ Centric Slow at HQ Top leader not Customer Centric Finance Driven 
It 's clear that your lead do n't really care about you 
Comms between leadership and tester lacking , equipment trouble slow to solve occasionally , comms between MN and LA are very limited and need to be improved , lot of `` hurry up and wait '' 
Fundamental problem with having to deliver so much to appease C level but not having resource , so stretching existing resource thin 
Funding is throttled by upper management 
Low confidence in the leadership management 
Bringing up an alternative opinion to managers/leads will not be met with open ear , but rather will be punished for trying to improve the status quo 
lopsided and most top-heavy in the industry Tons of corporate red-tape and no smooth process between entity ( Activision and Blizzard operate separately but want to work together ) 
Top heavy exec team and very big ego , constant job cut and restructuring creating more work for the people left 
98 % of management have been there for 10+ year and were a part of the company during it `` golden year '' 
Like I said , everyone in a management position ha been there for 10+ year and they 're not moving anywhere so your only option is to look for a better position outside the company 
Chief Communication Officer is awful , even worse than the previous one 
The CEO is a joke 
Leadership doe not interact with anybody , preferring to lock themselves in room all day , `` solving '' problem the company doe not care about 
The leadership team ha no chemistry , the president is out over his ski in term of experience , the marketing team is full of people who have no prior marketing experience , the product team ha never actually shipped a product , and the sale team is embarrassed by the product that they bring to market 
CFO 
The AB leadership team is incredibly competent and focused , but they should be way more communicative and proactive about getting in front of employee 
Control and decision tend to trickle down from the top 
coach class international business travel until VP level 
senior management pre-occupied by the whim of executive leadership 
Senior management lack of vision in creating a sustainable business model 2 
Comparing PMs in external role , the pay could be much higher 
[LISTSEP]
Bad news headline and lack of clear upward mobility is frustrating 
Political ha had some HR issue , slow-moving , risk-averse , some folk were contractor for over 7 year 
average pay , no good promotion chance within 
90 % of the people hired will have a terrible work ethic , poor social skill , and poor communication skill 
Contract job , and you have to wait a few month before reapplying 
Unless you intend on devoting yourself to standing out above everyone else and/or being hired internally to another position , do n't expect much in the way of career opportunity 
None , it ’ s a good place to work from home 
if you make a mistake at this company good luck keeping your position 
Took me several year to go from hired contractor to full time employee , even though I wa doing the same work full time employee were doing 
If you 're not on the Call of Duty team your career opportunity will be incredibly limited 
Little to no promotion 
Career pause 
Salary , Upper Management , Leadership , Communication 
Recently seen a pretty drastic drop in talent a many people have left for better pay and opportunity 
Pay is n't super competitive ; review process is a joke ; career progression is foggy at best 
There is no competitive pay and promotion to a better paying position is limited 
Few promotion 
The company seems to care more about profit instead of retaining talent 
This should be a great and fun company to work , in reality it is quite the opposite 
so low paid , no prospect 
so job security is non existent 
The company fails to promote it 's own and fails to move it 's best contractor to full time 
There is a high dependence on contractor who have little chance for full-time employment 
Do not let long the hour scare you away from applying whatsoever 
The team you ’ re a part of will directly influence your level of work and upper management exposure 
Little mobility to move within the company and try out different role 
If you aren ’ t a man , expect to be asked about your “ passion for gaming ” even after you are hired 
There are definitely some brilliant and visionary executive in the company but they are out-of-reach most of the time 
Making game is a business 
Long hour , slow career progression , meaningless `` value '' 
They work you to the bone and have ZERO room for professional growth 
Gives a very clear view of how businessmen view creatives 
all contract work and no full time employment , they always let go of people right away 
Low wage for QA 
Very few opportunity for upward mobility 
Not much career growth , unless you 're in programming 
For studio finance , it 's one of those job that you 'll have for a long time 
Very difficult to get promoted , and HR department will actively work against you ( surprisingly have a lot more say over promotion than your direct manager ) 
Not many to speak of ! Some job security concern when project come to a close 
Promotions are not likely for people with niche field of work 
The annual review process and the promotion process are pretty unclear 
Even though goal are set , promotion is really difficult and it 's often hard to understand why certain people are promoted versus others 
it wa a great place to work 
Inconsistent career pipeline within the business unit 
If you 're coming in anything below mid-level , this is a maddeningly frustrating place to try and make a career from the ground up 
Stale product line ; moving up is very difficult 
No room for growth , micro manager , poor talent , monotonous 
Low pay and almost zero upward mobility 
The test style is also antiquated , so staying with the company may prevent you from being marketable elsewhere 
Expect large amount of overtime and a seasonal hiring environment 
No work life balance , long hour , no career development , no long term vision 
Executive life may be worth it 
No room for career advancement 
New manager are usually very `` something to prove '' and go above and beyond , even throwing people under the bus to show how `` serious '' they are about their position 
If you do n't , some will see that that a being snubbed , and this can cost you your job 
Way too many producer where I am , and more than half are frustrated art director and game designer 
Low pay , not much in term of career advancement , small company , outdated technology 
Since studio often have their own HR rep , there is sometimes a disconnect and delay in the hiring process 
Once you get to middle management , the boy club is very apparent 
Generally only people from certain background can secure senior role 
A lot of work at Activision 
Low salary , limited promotion possibility 
If you are looking for a job you can learn more , this is not your desire place 
promotion path is very limited within the company 
Do not expect to become permanent there , they already have everyone they need a permanent , unless you get extremely lucky and they happen to lose a permanent tester for your language ( it happens but it 's rare ) , otherwise you can get a few week , a few month , to a maximum of 18 month of contract , then you will have to go 
You can know if you get extended on your last week of contract , even if you ask the manager before , they rarely know before 
Not very well paid , it is difficult to get a permanent position even if you are good at your job 
You get ridiculously short contract and then you never know if it is going to be extended 
No long-term contract and almost no hope of growing inside the company 
No progression for the future if you are n't Irish 
Also , the organization is awful and there is no chance of career advance unless you 're friend of the manager 
Long hour , poor job security , not a diverse product portfolio 
Not a great company for advancement 
Also Activision like to bleed game franchise dry , so you 'll find yourself mostly working on sequel year after year 
Low salary , few promotion awarded 
Fairness in promotion is not always insurred a only a few management position are available for grab 
Little or no trainning and average tenure is low 
Very low salary , very limited internal career progression , mostly temporary contract 
nothing really negative to say about the job 
Very hard to get permanent position 
No clear trajectory path 
Management is not great here 
severe lack of talent because of unwillingness from the company to spend to attract top talent 
Shortsighted vision regarding new game development 
Management 
Everyone feel constantly at risk of being fired 
HR process like review , talent planning , etc 
Do not expect to become permanent there , they already have everyone they need a permanent , unless you get extremely lucky and they happen to lose a permanent tester for your language ( it happens but it 's rare ) , otherwise you can get a few week , a few month , to a maximum of 18 month of contract , then you will have to go 
You can know if you get extended on your last week of contract , even if you ask the manager before , they rarely know before 
Not many training option once inside the company 
The company usually hire management or promotes selected member of the group 
High demand with no incentive 
Once you are hired , no one give the slightest thing about you 
If you work for them in the US is different 
No possibility of growing in the company , just small summer project 
For higher position like project manager etc , the company prefers outsources and hire people who do n't understand anything about video game and game industry , rather then invest on the talented people who already work there 
If you 're not on the VP 's top 10 list you 'll get no career advancement 
It is a job with no future or oportunities 
There is no difference if you do your job or you do n't 
Recruitment process took 8 week and 7 interview to finally get a job offer at the end 
Recruiters do not have a clear picture what the role are , the talent needed or how to interview 
Activision is going full time corporate/marketing game publisher and the old `` boutiuque '' mentatility is gone 
Questionable Business Ethics & Slow Career progression 
little to no career advancement -revolving door of leadership , the overwatch and call of duty league have had a new commissioner/president every year it feel like -the news story are correct , which loses the league sponsorship money -little to no communication with my manager -pay increase are le then inflation on a % basis -non-existent HR department , there is no head of HR let alone a reliable HR department -bonuses are insultingly small -massive layoff every year to two year -no career path discussion or roadmapping -common career advice for advancement is `` leave for another company for a couple year then come back for a higher job title '' 
-the good job are in game development not esports 
As with all tradeoff , this sluggishness provides a certain stability , even if it come at the cost of personal economic or career growth 
Not much variety in term of title to work on 
I went from being a Senior Engineer at another game studio to Associate here , and now I 'm told that I 'm under performing 
Culture is terrible , minimal focus on personal/career growth and development , no incentive to support development of peer and/or direct report 
Salary low compare with other company or studio for junior motion graphic designer 
As the title say , very boring , especially if you 're already not a big fan of COD or shooter ( there 's NOT a good chance you 'll work on any other title when you 're starting out ) 
Unless you 're a go-getter , love the corporate structure , really want to move up in Activision QA ( do n't expect to work your way up to a dev job from this position ) , and/or can , somehow , not get enough of COD , then you wo n't likely see any major raise or promotion 
They offer le than other company , a they expect people to want to work here 
Limited career growth opportunity : Advancement can be difficult with the preference seeming to be to fill open position with outside talent v 
internal promotion 
Bad Advancement opportunity 
Never know when you might get fired 
low salary and many work 
When new position are open , they are offered to the friend of management 
It is very difficult to move up due to lack of leaving and hiring in department outside of support 
The company is also very large with employee all over the world in several business unit and team , so there is a slight learning curve when joining 
Working in Marketing Creative wa the most dehumanizing experience of my career 
Half of the management in the department got their position by being in the right place at the right time 
The other half wa hired in , not based on their creative ability , but on how well they talk 
The constant , high level of turnover 
There 's practically ZERO career progression 
Lack of commitment to develop talent 
Very little room for advancement 
That feeling of , '' OMG I want to work for Blizzard 
`` Diversity '' : Blizzard preaches that they are very diverse but when it come to hiring , 8/10 will be men 
There are barely any woman in leadership role and those that are tend to be ignored or overruled by those higher than them 
From what I have seen there is currently a very high turnover rate at Blizzard 
This should be a great and fun company to work , in reality it is quite the opposite 
Poor , self-righteous leadership -No clear career path -very siloed -most employee seem to be phoning it in 
It is remarkable that anybody is still there , and I heard regularly from my peer group that those who do stay do so purely for financial reason ( the pay is competitive outside of equity ) 
The Santa Monica office is a dump Be prepared to be overworked if you work in finance or any of the support team 
attrition is really high a people burn out and realize there are much better prospect out there The leadership team is political in the extreme 
If they did come back for consecutive season , after their third they were required to be out for a year before they could return Lay-offs were far too frequent for full time employee Hard work wa rewarded with a larger workload and higher expectation Metrics for bonusable goal were geared to eventually become impossible to attain Little to no possibly for advancement I could really go on and on here 
No one is promoted without playing their card perfectly , and often time good employee are pigeon holed and kept from leadership position 
The job is n't very challenging and is n't for everyone 
Always the possibility of being sold but if you 're a hard worker it seems to be easy to get a job elsewhere because of the company reputation 
HR is not the best anymore because of a regime change 
QA Leads do n't really care about the brand new hire 
The position doe not encourage hiring the best people and the overall effort of retention and training is limited 
Outsourced a lot of QA job 
Difficult to move up 
No real room to move out of CS role in the Austin location 
Not the greatest communication between department and limited growth potential depending upon what career path you wish to follow 
management 
Sales role were more customer marketing focused v managing the 4Ps 
This is a QA perspective : Even with loyalty and competence it may still take you up to 3 year to become a permanent tester 
Even if you were really great at your job , if the timing wa not right , then you were not kept 
Politics , no career path , uncertain future 
low pay and little chance for progression 
Low salary compare to market and hard to progress or move to other team 
Can be long hour if role work with the US 
[LISTSEP]
They send you free stuff sometimes 
Pay is not competitive 
Low pay Long hour Crappy benefit Insulting developer Infuriating co-worker Activision doe a mass hiring every year for tester 
Everyone is paid the same , so the worst tester make a much a the best tester 
Good tester are rewarded with more work and responsibility for no extra pay 
All the profit go to the higher ups and they only raise tester pay if they absolute have to 
Low Pay 
pressure time commitment recohnition award 
Your boss will try to foster a `` family '' environment to abuse your trust and get more work for le pay out of you 
Pay is not competitive 
Company us an agency called Volt in order to avoid giving you thing like benefit , bonus , vacation time , etc 
The compensation wa very low 
No PTO Crunch Pay is unsustainable 
Pay ofcourse is bad eventhough the company make million of dollar 
It only pay $ 13 
Activision can easily afford to allow their tester a better quality of life , but don ’ t understand basic management 
Management constantly lays-off individual every year ( or people leave ) , and instead of hiring someone to back-fill the position , they spread the work around to the people that are left on the team and expect them to do the work with the same amount of pay 
This year 's compensation wa the worst anyone at the company ha ever seen 
They should give people benefit not withhold them from people who 've been working here for year 
Compensation is pretty bad 
Activision is an extremely siloed organization and the bonus system make collaboration a non-starter ( unless goal are aligned ) 
Low salary and mediocre benefit compared to some of the gaming /tech company in LA 
Perks not a great a other tech company 
The pay is not a good a some of the other top company 
They have some great policy and perk which might make it seem like they do , but once you get a glimpse beyond that , not so much 
Contract thru Volt service 
The company is getting fat and the management are arrogant 
Very low salary for Dublin 's cost of life 
Pay equality non-existent , also doe not reflect the hour you have to work during crunch 
The pay is quite low and benefit can be improved 
Pay not enough for dublin 
Pay , Overtime , Management , Kitchen , Desks 
Let 's first talk money 
As a tester , your salary is ridiculous for a city like Dublin , one of the lowest salary I have seen in this city 
You do not get paid per se for the overtime , you get hour in the system to use whenever you want or they will pay you some of it every few month 
Note , however , these long hour we not compensated through bonus like other studio 
The salary are a bit low due to the fact that it 's a `` passion industry '' , but not criminally low once you are above the entry level 
The pay is not great , you can work week end for month and sometimes stay until really late 
Short contract , pay is n't good 
The payment is definitely the worst thing 
Super tight deadline , lot of weekend work and extra hour required last minute , NO benefit whatsoever and minimum wage 
Temporal contract 
Low salary and high amount of weekly hour in busy project ( working Saturdays and Sundays ) 
Salaries tend to come up on the light side compared to software gig not within the game industry 
Salary is a little bit low compared to our importance a a Localization tester 
low salary compared to other QA job in Dublin 
Salary is quite low if you compare it with other company 
Low pay , abusive management , have to beg for holiday , no sick pay 
no game discount -pension contribution is low 
You better track your problem with salary or contract and push the management to give you response 
Poor pay , strict unfriendly management 
The salary can be higher for some position 
Politics , acquisition , compensation , lack of process 
A lot of week end overtime 
Rewards firefighter , which reward arsonist 
Let 's first talk about money 
As a tester , your salary is ridiculous for a city like Dublin , one of the lowest salary I have seen in this city

Terrible pay rise 
Before our studio wa acquired , pay rise were excellent 
As soon a Activision bought the studio pay rise dropped dramatically 
Wage could be easily improved 
For overtime work on Saturday , it 's paid normally 
Useless pay 
Bad pay and no lunch or supper even on late night No respect 
For the localization office there are no perk or bonus 
High expectation , Low salary , ton of overtime 
fixed term contract , no canteen , low salary 
Low pay , no good benefit , in general , they are very cheap 
Also pay is not competitive 
No benefit and no equity 
pay wa low , and opportunity for advancement low 
QA doe n't get a much pay a it should 
Compensation is on the lower side compared to tech company 
need more pesonnel in each department 
underpaid and no benefit for contractor，not good for stay longer time because there is such a limited number of people could get transfer a stuff！ 
Pay is a bit low -Atmosphere is very political and toxic 
Overall compensation based on project assignment and sale which is somewhat out of your control 
low salary , no raise , benefit not good 
New CPO started changing too much and taking thing in the wrong direction Corporate is so disconnected from what their money-making Studios do Poor base pay make poaching a piece of cake Lack of innovation and franchise fatigue 
Pay wa not the best and no benefit for full-time temporary role 
Salary isn ’ t a competitive a other company 
even after pay increase 
little to no communication Poor compensation 
Pay , hour , No PTO , not many benefit 
Pay is significantly lower than competitor 
It wa half of last year just because the money wa skewed to pay devs more 
Pay is well below market , yearly merit increase are a joke 
Pay : Low of the low 
Pay raise are very rare ! Also , do n't ask for a raise 
Compensation is pretty bad 
Pay can be better 
Successful jerk rampant , lack diversity , pay could be better 
blizzard ha changed from player-targeted to money targeted 
During extremely busy period the only time spent out of work wa commuting and sleeping Compensation wa dismal at best Competent , well trained employee were rare and after they were laid off they did n't come back 
If you 're a young person that can handle being fed through a meat grinder a a QA Tester for a couple of season , the pay is decent ( though you wo n't get benefit unless you elect to receive them and pay a hefty premium nor will you receive a bonus ) and you 'll get plenty of overtime making the paycheck pretty nice 
I believe budget allocation for raise were skewed 
low salary , no benefit , work a a temp 
recognition for service ( 5/10/15 year ) 
pay could be better for temporary employee 
Then again like I mentioned above you are rewarded for it 
compensation compared to industry standardst Management is strictly out for their own good v 
Low pay , corporate red tape 
The pay is FAR to low and there is zero job security 
The pay is low and there are no benefit 
We get 2 day notice for weekend OT even though employee asked about weekend work more than a week before and we know making a team in advance is completely possible ( it 's easier to tell people they wo n't work in the end than telling them to volonteer for extra work 2 day before the weekend , but it look like this concept is too complicated for them a it happens every single month on every project ) 
As a tester , if your language is common , you are replacable , and a such you get paid le than some colleague who do the same job for a different language and your contract will not get extended past two year 
This is considered part of our core salary 
Compensation is appreciated , but is far more generous in other company 
Management communication is lacking Increasing number of responsibility , same pay 
low salary and no long contract
