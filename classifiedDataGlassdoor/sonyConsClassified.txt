Corporate culture can be seen a either a pro or a con , depending on how creatives view this 
Very corporate 
Moral is down , lot of layoff , business situation is rough 
Do not encourage those people to continue that behavior 
You ca n't ever get anywhere because all the upward movement is totally based on politics , and the Japanese do NOT care about your opinion-It 's their culture

Management prefers to “ manage out ” toxic employee instead of firing them 
Worked Japanese hour around the clock , 8 am to 9 pm some day , 
Japanese hierarchy culture where feedback to innovate is not valued 
Nothing is considered negative here 
Many people at Sony have worked here for a very long time ; year and year ; that they are comfortable and not so compelled to push the envelope and try new thing 
Nothing is bad here it 's all great 
Treat people horribly , highly political and paranoid , no transparency or open communication 
Basic corporate culture 
Culture is cutthroat and unsupportive 
Local people feel they are not really valued 
if you want to get to the top you have to be Japanese 
Created a toxic/unaccountable environment 
Hours are extremely long and the culture of the environment is driven by competitiveness and fear of not succeeding 
Poor management ; everyone for themselves environment ; den of snake type atmosphere ; although there is a Ethics hotline , many employee are left unprotected and often retaliated against when they speak up 
dont feel respected at this company 
The japanese look at anyone not Japanese a inferior 
Refused to accept Samsung and LG a real competitor 15 year ago and lost the battle

Long hour that are expected due to company culture 
Decision-making is slow and Tokyo-centric 
Sony 's not serious about this business 
Very rigid process driven organisation Not sale oriented and that is why they messed up properly 
HR department need replacing , some high level exec are more concerned with covering their behind than doing what is best for the company , no Employee Stock Purchase Plan , too much outsourcing , aging office ( soon this will change for the better ) , corporate culture need a makeover , my department enforced business casual dress code ( it the 21st century guy and Sony is not a blood sucking/soul destroying bank )

Old company , doing thing really traditional 
Ensure Sony ha a commitment to marketing and developing product for the US market 
Very Japanese 
Discouraging work environment , throw under the bus culture 
tough work culture with too much self entitlement 
Despite sharing an office with Sony Network Entertainment , we never collaborated with them , which wa representative of the fractured corporate structure 
The typical thing is for each internal business unit to look out for itself rather than the company and customer at large , which mean that while Sony often design great hardware , the interface and user experience and complementarity between product often fall short

Too many chief and not enough indian to execute their vacillating wish 
Unfortunately there doe not seem to be a culture of openness willing to listen to critique

Constant pushing for more and more output with 100 % quality 
Encourages practice that break the store code of conduct in regard to aggressive sale technique 
Sony is a kind of traditional company , the speed for catch up the new biz mode is quite slow 
Sony aim to be really profitable which mean that Sony is very demanding and employee have to be very efficient and effective 
be punctual , working overtime , 
The company ( or at least the decision maker on hiring ) are not in favor of hiring Arabs , Westerns , other nationality 
No skill development only commen sense 
Japanese traditional working culture , calculative , low starting base salary , high turnover rate , equal treatment towards low and top performer , etc 
Maybe it 's German style 
struggling company , no corporate culture , japanese , with unskilled team leader , unethical behaviour tolerated 
They said , `` leaving sony is almost dying '' 
Unable to change 
Loss of local autonomy 
Old-school Japanese company in a few point 
A nice team of qualified and high skilled accountant lost on the very unhealthy environment most of the time avoidable if we had real manager with a proper attitude and approach 
It 's Bangi 
Even if you go overseas for a business/work trip , weekend , night , morning are considered working hour and you are expected to come in the very next working day ! Too many beautiful slide which are not necessary 
No nice coffee ! No healthy food or snack 
Culture here is n't fun at all 
Old way of working Timing Late sitting People Management Politics 
i lost challenging spirit which i had when i wa fresh man 
Lacked leadership for company which had great vision otherwise 
The biggest problem of Sony is that they need to rejuvenate the brand 
The Japanese culture is so focus on hard work that sometimes people feel bad about having a life outside the company 
so that we need to go same time everyday 
Most of the business area lost the Sony spirit 
Declining market , so moral can be low 
80/20 rule always apply in this company 
Working hour are very long with management encouraging even longer hour 
japanese culture hard to learn 
Should improve the Work Culture 
Limitation to align with local requirement 
Working culture is such that long working hour is a norm and expected 
to many people worried about covering their butt 
Some team have internal politics 
keep your hand away 
company ha a tendency to be at ease even when thing are burning 
too strict to the working environment and hierarchy 
Girls are not treated with respect in some team 
If you refuse to change your current project they will degrade you morally 
They believe their success from the 1980 's is still relevant today and that being a market leader once mean you will always be one ( which is not the case ) 
The Japanese culture and mentality is forced throughout the entire company 
Culture not a strong a it used to be 
Do n't promote the right people Value personal relationship over performance High school mentality 
corp culture usa is and odd mix 
While this is one of the least Japanese company , there is a strong influence on the Japanese network and management

Old friend and colleague from the day of Ericsson Mobile tend to watch each others back to secure that no `` outsider '' are let in 
Narrow minded and non compliant 
difficult to integrate the conservative Sony way of working with the Ericsson 
Business were decreasing during my last year in the company which effected the moral and spirit of the company negatively 
If you are afraid to take responsability and make desicions on your own this is not the Company för you 
We are not working a one company , supporting and respecting eachother 
company should maintain it 's brand value 
If you are non-Japanese , you always come second to them 
Too little emphasis on individual capability and freedom of expression 
Sony is company of silo where each individual subsidiary sub optimizes for them self 
Has become very UK-centric over the year which ha impacted the performance and engagement of the local country 
Too many conflict between Swedish and japanese culture 
Managers are either Swedes or Japaneses , so the interaction with manager ha to be adjusted from time to time 
more openness and fairness element should be incorporated in the company culture 
The brand expectation should be met 
I guess that why they shut down the rdu place 
Laid-back -Getting le innovation -Poorer management -Unclear vision and mission 
Lack of transparency and professionalism 
This is a company with democratic in nature , no one care whether you work hard or not 
So they think they are not responsible for their resource 
This created a culture of `` Backroom Managers '' that were unable to effectively sell , coach , or inspire their staff to perform 
They still work on old method and open to new idea 
You can not take even a stationary item ( Stapler , Marker etc 
Even if the employee ha some personal problem to deal with , they wont leave you 
They dnt care about staff 's personal view and plan 
They do n't trust you at all 
My previous company had much better facility and culture 
5 ) Culture is non-cooperative and over work is high expectation with no overtime pay 
6 ) Company do n't believe in keeping employee happy 
Efficiency is not encouraged either , so people need to do a lot of repeated work and attend so many meeting 
Sweden , Central , Legacy , Old platform , Long decissions 
Morale is kept up by touting the company line of reaching annual business plan even though profit goal are reduced yearly 
Strong silo and `` not invented here '' culture 
Management is not machure enough and can not plan long term 
Not speaking Japanese will be a great drawback 
People in sweden need to show some commitment and appreciation of the current situation that the company find itself in 
completely controlled by Japan-side 
not keen on partnering Customers do n't figure in our conversation except a 'things ' to keep at a distance 
Seems somewhat characteristic of Japan however 
Macho management style

Too many middle management job and too much offshore , what demotivate some engineer that come here to create and eventually they are just managing cheaper labour in other country 
Middle management is full of career maker without any concern for the company interest Top management ha no clue about the product or service ( after Morita-san died ) Mushroom shaped and disfunctional organization 
management is not visible to some locatios 
Engineer skill level is low 
training system is poor 
promotion based on seniority & quota , so if your dept ha too many ppl of the same seniority 
u wont get promoted on time due to the quota limitation 
while colleague in other depts with same seniority will be promoted 
boring colleague were all stupid no career progression 
Poor Technical Talent Pool 
Freshers are hired for Cultural Activities Management is happy to do Testing Projects Compensation is below market standard Japanese consider India a Testing 
from the talent point of view , all talent are escaping and that 's normal , if a company doe n't do anything for the employee ( no career , no understanding of the strength of the people , no marketing at all , no course to personal develop , etc ) 
There is a lot of middle manager and the career path is n't always clear , unless you know the right people 
a a product company in a highly competitive market , the job risk are higher 
Favoritism wa how promotion were handed out 
Over the 5 year that I wa working in the company , witnessed many occasion of wrong person in the wrong job 
too many change for company orgniazation 
internal promotion & assessment is below level 
Lack of experience in some management position 
in it will help for the carrier and job vacancy 
Promotion is extremely limited and is through who you know rather than what you know 
Far too many silo in Sony , Management is inexperienced and no one is ever recruited externally to bring world class talent to the organisation 
More than half of the employee are consultant 
Recruit those few who know theory through 
Working in Japanese 
Bureaucratic working environment 
For fresh graduate from NIT/IIT , it may not prove to be good place to work because u may land in some maintenance or testing project 
bad management nill career growth no stablility in the company 
After 2009 there wa considerable underemployment 
Hiring people from distant country and after 2 month the office closure wa announced 
The Managerial cadre 
Downside being the lack of promotion to move on and make something of myself 
Not an employ friendly organizasion 
No scope of diversified work 
They put a table and chair , it becomes your work place 
Promotions are unheard of 
Not flexible in work from home 
I have worked for more than 2 year a a software engineer in Sisc 
* Cons * Sony Needs a Salary Analyst 
They recruit people from low ranked college , most of them doesnt have enough skill to work in s/w domain 
*1 year of on-job training for a fresher is of no use 
* The company ha no faith on their recruitment 
So , they are not short of application any time 
Unclear strategy Internal promotion process Middle maganagement not always competent Separation in activity / subsidiary 
Organizationally very flat with almost no opportunity for advancement 
Promotions are given out not on merit , but on popularity and exposure 
Sony of Canada offer `` job '' a opposed to `` career '' to potential employee 
Interns are non-paid but the job doe not have to be full time 
Mobility is difficult a far a advancement within the company 
4 ) No facility for employee like other company 
Work here is at Testing , Execution and Maintenance ( TEM ) 
No guarantee for a fresher to which project he will be put into 
10 Months of on-job training literally is of no use 
Very low pay and very slow promotion 
Almost need at least 3 year to be promoted in every level , from general staff to supervisor , than to assistant manager , than to manager , than to senior manager 
So even if you are super excellent , it take you around 10 year to be a manager , which will kill your motivation 
A lot of good experience wa lost in the last downsizing ; many of those people would 've gladly worked together to improve , but the leadership wa too willing to take improper risk with the product to get them launched on time 
No career progression plan for younger employee 
expect you to work blindly until an opportunity is `` given '' to you ( coworker above you quits/laid off ) 
ladder to climb 
dissatisfied management leadership and unfairness of promotion 
It is unfair promotion system 
Lack of HR process Lack of career management Lots of travel Decision making often unclear and lack of process make for a challenging environment to get thing done 
Very limited communication with academia , especially for young researcher 
Be really patient for promotion 
Company is closing door in RTP ; there is no more work to do ; many people have left already ; do n't apply unless you want to go overseas 
Most promotional opportunity are overseas , If you ca n't travel or relocate your advancement opportunity are limited 
The promotion do n't reflect performance 
hard to correct bad salary and hard to advance if not having lot of luck 
Long hour Inflexible Poor leader Japanese get best job , but do n't stay to see thing through Lack of vision Still in denial about ipod Dull office Little development , although improving for some people Very poor at change Do n't see thing through Suspicious of outsider 
Got hired and thrown at a job on your own 
Promotions only based on network contact
