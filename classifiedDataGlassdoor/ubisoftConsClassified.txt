In fact , one person calling me name , wa a lesbian just trying to fit in with the guy 
Especially considering I know another language 
Da Nang is cool and all , but do n't expect the same modern convenience a HCMC or Ha Noi ( shopping/repairing/social event 
low salary , only visual support in difficult situation , reverse gender polytics ( preferring inclusive instead of proffiency ) 
Diversity and inclusion are making is making good stride but still work to be done 
Your pay will scale to your race 
At Ubisift it so cool because all of people are friendly 
Still a family company , french and family taking the lead in all region Some subsidiary HR disconnected from Global Micro management Decision based in bias not by using data Lack of diversity and inclusion 
The diversity culture is going a bit far in Ubisoft a they already have an application process that considers the diversity of an applicant and make it somewhat relevant 
( Hike % for female are more than male ) 
Your only possibility is sharing a flat with other people 
Open space 
French company , hard to integrate a non-French speaker 
Management quality very eclectic between two department 
Lots of different nationality 
At one formal teleconference with the Editorial Board over in Paris , they asked if the meeting could be conducted in French , even though they knew 6 of the 8 devs on our side of the monitor were primarily English-speaking 
Ambient noise : Ubisoft love open environment 
[LISTSEP]
French company with heavy EU bias 
You will not share in the profit a a support worker 
very slow process and old school mindset 
Very political `` family '' environment , toxic manager permitted to stay , siloed department , entertainment industry ego 
Very low pay in the market Toxic work culture 
people idolize management People are set in their way and not open to change Some difficult personality that create a toxic environment Not a lot of perk 
They also do n't respect artist nor do they understand creative process 
A pro that sometimes turn into a con : they will not fire employee unless there is a very serious reason 
Ubisoft ha a culture of consensus that sometimes make it difficult to make business decision 
I wa robbed the second time when the fire exit door wa remarkably left open , allowing more hobo to come in and steal my personal belonging this time 
Management wa horrifying about the ordeal , claiming it wa my fault my stuff got stolen the second time because a companywide e-mail wa sent telling people not to have their personal item at work 
So , you ca n't customize your desk on the fear of being robbed 
I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , but the company had an unhealthy obsession with buying skim milk for everyone 
Instead of hiring a maid to clean dirty dish , management would often throw away dirty dish , cup , and silverware , rather than clean them 
Bare minimum quality , Any time an opportunity arose to go above and beyond for the customer , they just refused 
Lots of toxic player play Rainbow six seige -Customer service department is told they a loss mitigation and that they have no value 
This is n't necessarily a con because they 're smart but it 's also not negotiable and you will only go so far unless you are fluent in French 
Nothing is bad about ubisoft because it a heven for those who love making game and love playing game and i just want to tell you all that ubisoft is the place where programers get respect 
Loyalty-over-competency kind of environment 
Ubisoft is very much a `` follower '' company , not a `` leader '' company 
Unless you want to be treated like crap , and have no Holidays off ( because we 're a French company of course ) , stay at your own risk 
Many employee will learn that you will need to fight for yourself and your success 
If you 're not french , hang it up 
Corporate culture of producing game is growing worse 
Not a data-driven logical culture 
Feelings and creativity reign here 
The company is rediculously secretive apparently due to investor 
Not a great corporate culture 
They 're strict on in and out and management doe n't communicate well with the overall team 
-People who are able to multitask and have multiple thing going on get their chewed out for multitasking -Inter office politics is a terrible thing here 
While the 'shoot from the hip ' style is mostly fun , there is a lot of room for improvement around the discipline of the business 
Training is not a part of the culture , a another reviewer pointed out and this clearly need to be addressed a an necessity to retain top talent 
Grain of salt for the disgruntled reviewer who have left and want to leave a swath of destruction behind them 
Very political Unreasonable expectation Very French culture 
Culture might be a little bit different 
Company only pay lip service to it value 
If you ai n't in with the cool kid , you 're screwed 
Seniority is not appreciated there 
terrible management and HR , no respect , harassment , no evolution 
Especially in Ubisoft Abu Dhabi , you will find a bullying culture in the development team that management personally created and foster to oppress opinion and development of their employee just to get their personal opinion across 
directly against the studio 's own value , which is terrible 
What is developed , because of this culture , is poor and often time delayed 
No con , No con , No con 
Often a toxic work environment , management lack experience , production culture varies widely from team to team 
It 's unfortunate they do n't value their current employee 
Get used to having a french friend having to represent you if you ever need to deal with stuff 
Not the best work culture : Within my first 3 week , I wa warned of a half dozen coworkers to `` never get in a car with 
They still walked around the office talking about which female coworkers they would bang 
Company prioritizes experience by amount of game shipped above all else , disregarding actual skill level 
management at time can be le competent , it 's a family business so more politics driven promos v 
Being French-owned with it HQ in Paris , the cultural difference add a complexity to the workplace regardless of what function you are in 
Company level decision do n't seem to be taken towards the employee ( like team that could be fully autonomous is WFH are called back to the office to keep the `` Ubisoft Culture '' ) 
Egos and team chemistry varies heavily from project to project 
bad work culture ( incident of sexual harrasment and bullying ) 
no culture to evolve and push further 
Do n't Go there if you do n't like to be micro managed day to day 
Toxic culture 
HR doe n't take sexual harassment case seriously , no outcome even when I submit a complaint 
not a safe place for woman to work 
Low pay Toxic manager High turnover ( everyone is leaving ) It 's a horrible place to work and their culture of institutional harassment is very real and very bad 
Low pay compared to the amount of work HQ always come first Hierarchy is over bearing , they need to control everything but it can vary with the team and project The company culture ha a hard time adapting to the new challenge 
An absolutely morally bankrupt company 
some senior developer want to write code only how they know to do it 
Frat boy culture 
Crunch culture 
I 'm not going to talk about the abuse , shitty corporative culture too much but they are NOT doing anything about it , definitely 
The French simply doesn´t like Anglophones 
Everything is good about Ubisoft 
Very organic and chaotic sometimes ( empowerment and freedom show their limit ) Games pipeline is a bit repetitive and boring for a company that preaches innovation and creativity 
we are follower in many case 
Ubisoft is without any doubt an organisation which is completely void of meaningful value 
it no good place for any minority or woman in general 
Also , they spy on worker social medium habit and have a culture of harassment ( which they have yet to fix ; just read the news 
etc If you want to be treated with basic human decency then Ubisoft is not the place for you , unfortunately 
Reputation of the company make you not proud to be where you are 
Ubisoft is a family run company with 15k employee , and it show 
Absolutely everything about the company is top-down and about enabling the family to keep control 
This enables cronyism and cliquishness , which in the worst-cases result in the type of harassment and toxicity that´s been in the news in the last couple of year 
No con , never , forever , always 
But they 'll tell you it 's okay because `` everyone is like a family '' 
But here 's the thing : just because you do n't expect unpaid overtime from people regularly and just because you do n't have toxic working condition doe n't mean you can exploit people 
Co-dev studio dictate all the term of engagement , even if they create toxic environment and borderline sexual harassment 
Young , unframed , open and creative 
Surrounding culture is in the news for how terrible it is 
low pay abusive practice corrupt hr unwillingness to change frat boy culture no longer at the creative forefront unsafe working condition 
# metoo stuff 
Treats employee like slave , with a clear hierarchy that end and start with him 
Any employee that speaks up is , and have been fired 
Please do n't consider this place 
You ca n't do anything without 10 confirmation , hand are always tight , no space for decision making 
A bit of crunch culture 
I witnessed harassment , retaliation , and the encouragement of toxicity 
Very much a mafia type culture , where senior people all know each other so do each other favour , even if it ’ s frowned upon 
Directors are either untouchable or do n't care about other misbehaving director 
low income , barely enough for Bucharest 
low salary , dont try to keep asset and prefer turnover 
very corporate 
Lots of medium lash out ( with reason ) Tencent sugar baby Old white male dominance 
-The HR team doe not keep employee anonymity when reporting an issue 
( Example : Chaitanya Girme ) 
Not inclusive culture , Ubisoft is not a inclusive a it think it is especially to woman , minority , non-French speaking worker and POC 
Management and complete disrespect for their employee 
Always compare themselves to the worst employer and have a `` if you do n't like it , quit ! '' mentality 
Together , they 've created the worst atmosphere ever , and if anyone new come in with energy , they make sure they beat it out of them 
Management is built on misogyny and nepotism 
Less salary , Politics within team 
Unpaid overtime , some team feel like a boy 's club , very very white , casual sexism can be heard , very alcohol oriented party , 
Kyiv office ca n't do any decision , everyone is at mercy of HQ and lead development studio 
Likable company to join no con from me 
Highly toxic work environment where employee are bullied and disrespected by the production management 
All complaint to HR will be ignored a they view employee a disposable 
The company demand 100 % loyalty 
The company ha a “ if you have a problem , you can leave ” mindset knowing that not everyone can leave suddenly specially during covid time 
When you complaint about overtime and other unfair practice , they will say this is how gaming industry is 
Nothing , everything is good here 
Some people make this place a very toxic environment 
Can be difficult to fit in if you are not part of the Quebec/France culture 
Legacy code all over the place 
Extremely toxic atmosphere : all complaint and promising suggestion are ignored and the responsibility ( and literally blame ) is being relayed to mids and junior 
It doe not feel like The Ubisoft who develops great game and move the industry forward 
The general tone within the studio ( and at least within the studio I worked in ) is somber , and a lot of u discovered ourselves in retrospect to have been sold the idea of an inclusive and healthy environment by those manager ( that a of recently were suspended , then fired from the company ) , and came to realize the hypocrisy 
And so is the working culture 
and many more thing on the other level such a trying to be independent studio instead of collaborate more and move forward together 
Many internal politics and strong emphasis on the brand 
Sometimes toxic culture , depending on the team 
Not true to their own company culture 
pretty much everything related to social and moral standard , if you 're not management you 're treated like an object , salary is half the market 's price 
A lot of political choice , people that are at Ubisoft for 20 year making the decision and a weird `` college '' kind of vibe ( who date who , gossip , booze , 
The company culture and diversity could be better 
Bad culture and low competence of the management team 
Very political environment with a ( now well reported ) toxic culture 
Unstable culture , company take political side and seems to ignore the principle of innocent until proven guilty 
my moral dont align with that Very Low salary 
Policies made to make sure you wo n't relocate to another studio within the firm 
French favouritism persists , sometimes it said to be equal opportunity for all , however if you do not speak french for a first language or it elementary then you will run into problem with manager and HR 
Unpleasant working environment : racism , homophobia , colleague constantly trying to avoid working 
No parking space for 4 wheeler 
Maybe too big Afraid to take risk 
Not embeded in the prod so the lab ha it own politics and it 's considered a a separate service which can make collaboration with the floor difficult to set up ( whereas the marketing or com devs are hired and managed by the core team ) 
There were instance of harassment that were hushed up , and never felt with 
if you are a quiet and shy person like myself , it may be a little hard to “ fit in ” the company culture 
While the company ha evolved positively in it treatment of misconduct and harassment , a plague in the video game industry , there are still many long-time employee that are known harasser , past or present , and are protected in their position 
Fidelity is valued to an extreme at Ubisoft , and sometimes trust is misplaced 
Space and perk are n't a good a other studio , but I find the culture here much better 
2 ) Testers are not respected by developer and higher authority 
Terrible atmosphere , toxic environment , nepotism , low pay , and they dont care about their customer 
The studio ha a big lack of culture and value , and the direction is one of the worst I have ever seen in my life 
Their progressive culture and value are a facade for the public 
Your team and your project dictate the quality of work , stress level and sometimes use of technology 
Different team have different management policy , quality standard and knowledge-sharing initiative 
No incentive to be loyal to the company 
salary might be lackluster because they know they get you with the company culture 
At Ubisoft , everyone ha a say in the decision and nobody is entitled to respect the decision made 
Factory like mind-set 
Tight ambience 
I did n't trust them anymore and I quit – Employees are treated like number , not like human 
And they make sure to threat you and issue you character certificate for no reason 
Its quite evident from all of their policy that encourage a slave culture 
It ’ s a more open culture if you manage to work on team under anglophone management 
Employees & honest opinion are not valued 
Culture is very toxic overall , only yes men can survive 
Community is too related on game 
Noone care , suggestion for change are frowned upon and rejected , everyone is complacent 
Not everyone agrees to company core value 
a weird consensus based decision making culture , that can slow down many local initiative 
Backstabbing culture 
poor salary , SJW company , tester are treated like crap 
Backstabbing culture 
Women get treated like garbage 
Good employee thanks to the company culture 
Some people/team trend to delegate stuff on other team 
Typically , a lack of autonomy due to large team scale and being a subservient studio to other project ; this second point would n't be so much of an issue if this studio could fully buy-into the idea that it should be helping other team and stop trying to rock the boat 
Mid and High management favorise a human philosophy 
) -artists are provided with out of date software and are constrained to work using old method -management have a high opinion of their game and hardly challenge their method -it 's clearly not a place where artist thrive on their work 
French company with french management team 
Not knowing french might hurt you 
It look like another sallary-man Japanese office , just without the suit 
Ubisoft Osaka had none of that and it wa a shame because it kill the passion of the work we did 
Can be very beaurocratic and still operates in traditional way 
Every project is like it own little company 
Culture change a lot from a project to another 
Do n't communicate with each other 
The management is very tight lip , with little transparency below 
•values quantity over quality •tools that often make game development slow and frustrating •often barely working is good enough , while , in my opinion , it should not be 
not open to open source , Perforce shop 
Administration and HR are agressive and do not respect their co-worker 
Too many cultural issue at work 
Nothing found bad , good company 
Old school management 
When middle management is not strong the team suffers because of company dynamic 
working overtime without pay is like a compulsion bc if you wo n't do it they will bring that point out in performance review and you 'd not be given any increments/promotion 
Conservative , salary is not competitive 
The culture is cliquey 
Definitely a party culture 
this is fine but when you disagree and escalate to Paris , they want you to follow what Montreal doe 
people are afraid to speak out 
Do n't go to high in the hierarchy , it become an ejection seat No real place for creativity They do n't respect their employee 
A lot could change in the company culture if Vivendi take over 
Employees seem to care about their own work only , with disregard on how it impact other 's people work 
If you are not part of the `` inner circle/culture '' you will have hard time fitting in 
Have to be French to archive something 
Some tester , devs , and manager have an air of false superiority , and treat others like garbage 
Think Gun N Roses `` Welcome to the Jungle '' type of office politics 
The top tier of the company is a small clique of friends/relatives from 30 year ago , some of them have not scaled alongside the company and do n't quite have the professional ethic 
As such , they tend to let thing un-managed instead of making bold move 
With the continued growth at the studio , culture could suffer if it 's not cared for 
Cliques ( get in or you 're out ! ) 
* Editorial Board in Paris ha a stranglehold on every decision 
* Without a doubt the most political game development company I 've ever worked for ( out of seven ) 
Ubisoft Montreal is the epitome of `` it 's not what you know , it 's who you know 
`` That maxim is what Ubi Montreal is all about 
The management wa n't on sync with the team goal , lot of questionable decision making the product and the team waste time and resource deemed valuable 
The bar is set high in this company ; everyone is expected to perform 
-Good game culture and graphic background 
Strong French influence 
You are expected to work long hour 
Very cliquey , If you 're not in the `` in '' crowd or do n't speak french then you can easily become an outsider 
Very , Very big team Pays lip service to ethical issue which manifest themselves in the video game industry Derivative idea on major project 
Why are they leaving now ? Do you think the trend can be easily dismissed , or is this part of a deeper cultural problem ? What changed in the short year between the success of GRP till now ? 
Culture ha also shifted in recent year from that which wa very family-like and people-centric , to that which is bottom-line and resource-centric 
Your fate is fixed by the club 
on average 20-30 % lower than anywhere else for the same position ( their the excuse : `` but we have this amazing culture , and we work on these amazing game , plus newcastle is cheap '' ) Overtime 
needed , based on peer pressure ( to be honest , it wa slowly improving ) Company value 
Have some shame 
Now it 's totally on you that how you make an example in front of other company 
You 're not supposed to say anything about it , it 's not your place 
well , French 
Massive office politic work environment 
[LISTSEP]
The 10h day and the intensity 
Time off is hard to get at time 
A lot of work to do on and you need to spend your weekend working from home 
Too long time spent in work 
crazy hour but overall not bad 
They 'll make you realize that working should n't be something you do because you have to , it should be something you do because you 're driven and passionate 
Managerial expectation do not match workload 
Lack of accessibility Strict time Hard to work on a bad day 
Chalenging work and long hour 
The company sits somewhere between a large corporation and a fast paced tech setting 
You are expected to work like a robot copying and pasting answer which 99 % of the time doe not resolve the customer concern 
Believe me when I say this , you will regret quitting your full time for this job 
WFH is only allowed dependent on your manager 
Scheduling wa unreliable , which wa very annoying 
burnout not uncommon , high turnover in marketing department , working weekend not uncommon during major pulse point 
Work-life balance can get a bit iffy 
I lost 1-month worth of work 
-Producers managed time but lied about the time we had to finish our part of the game 
They expect you to make up the time we missed in OT 
Working really long hour , especially leading up to the launch of a game 
Work-life balance is sometimes difficult to achieve 
Care more about the time on the phone then helping the customer 
Not a great maternity leave or work from home policy 
Working there ha become a part of my life that I just want forget and move on from 
Work-life balance is tough 
They give the marketing team `` summer hour '' on Friday 's but no one us them 
Buyer beware -Senior member openly state that `` we do n't do training '' despite promoting itself a a 70/20/10 company -HR is completely powerless to address systemic issue which include : -Awful work-life balance -Complete unwillingness to change process ( or lack thereof ) e 
There 's lot to get done with too few people to get it done so people are often exhausted 
Typical game industry crunch , poor work/life balance , management ha little experience operating at the AAA level 
The appeal of working `` in the industry '' a a gamer might be enough to make that a wash for many , but not fair when you also consider the stress that come up that 
work life balance is n't great 
Need to be able to think and work globally 
Having to work at night sometimes ( depending on what event were best to execute ) -Having a limit on how many hour per campaign ( only matter if you want to work a lot ) 
This is n't a bad thing , however time can go very quickly due to daily work and project and you have to find time to push yourself forward in order to gain recognition 
I never understood how time-off worked 
and in the current state of the industry , if you snooze , you lose 
Some of the employee are nice and cool but a lot of them fall into the gamer geek category 
A lot of meeting and bureaucracy , not a lot of opportunity to talk to manager 
Low pay ( everyone is underpaid and over overworked ) 
salary doe not match level of responsibility no respect and value to employee too much politics exploit passion of gamers no work life balance 
Salary and sometimes work-life balance 
Poor salary compared to Abu Dhabi living cost , poor school cost coverage , at least 2 over time day per week going to 11PM , not beneficial for family life , not beneficial from an european point of view 
Workload happens and it 's ok but is not rewarded a it should be 
Office a little bit empty due to covid 
Can work on bringing studio together 
Work life balance : email and team message come at all time of the day or night , and while you are not obligated or expected to respond , the unwritten rule is that you must respond 
People applying to front office department should not expect a good work/life balance 
However , the US subsidiary maintains enough independence to dilute this redtape so one is not completely flustered and frustrated 
Commuting is a challenge 
overtime not so many not so many 
Large-scale QA/QC but small-scale production 
Bad leave management system and le leaf 
Sometime we spend more time resolving technical issue than doing art 
Too much workload , very tiring 
No matter which industry you work in , there is always that one bad egg , unfortunately , that cause other employee some upset and make the working day more difficult 
Hybrid workplace : 3 day in the office , 2 at home 
Sometimes you have to find 60-80 bug per day ! That ’ s a lot 
In your free time , 
Our mission depend on the project ( there can be a lot of project like none at all ) 
A lot of people work there and it can feel overwhelming at time 
Work relies a lot on external studio , making force some weird schedule at time to be able to sync with them 
although the office is moving to a new location soon , so that could be the reason why ? ! It ha been more difficult in recent time to interact with colleague in different teams/projects , mainly because of Covid/social distancing , but in recent month studio activity seem to have ramped up and hope for this to continue 
Separation between team , sometimes socialize with the whole studio is complicated 
Overall people on the floor are great and talented but poor management practises and people ruin everything 
The downtime just get obnoxious 
A lot of overtime ( poorly managed project ) 
A lot of idle time waiting for task because of the lack of organization 
Working hour ( but depends on the team and the role ) 
The problem is the fact that people in the industry and generally overworked , overstressed and underpaid 
Sometimes you might be overworked , especially before the launch of a game , a they 're not always enough person assigned on a project 
Low salary but considering the work it ok Too much comfort zone 
They 'll point out that other game publisher have massive overtime/crunch issue and at least the company ha work/life balance 
Low salary Bad work-life balance There is a disconnect with upper management 
Poor money income , below average lifestyle 
Also the hour are 9h hour a day , yet they constantly praise a work life balance 
It 's more than anywhere I 've ever worked in my life and working 45h a week somewhere it 's impossible to drive because there 's no parking leaf no for life 
Your whole day is work and it 's insulting to constantly hear how much they believe in `` work life balance '' 
The studio is close to being closed 
Can be really hectic sometime 
N/A ( hey , I 'm an workaholic so nothing bad for me xD )

Overtime not paid , it ’ s not consistent 
Long hour , bad management , office too remote 
Stress and pressure vibe Not a lot of team building and social activity , since nobody ha time for that *Cons might be studio/project specific 
busy workload occasionally but it is not the worst thing 
You have to keep this guy happy ( it doe n't matter if you do n't work ) or you would be kick out 
They overwork everyone and when they 're questioned , their reply is `` this is how it is in video game '' 
No Brain storming work and le work load 
low salary , work from home 
Hard work , demanding , more free time 
Processes take time to adapt to WFH 
Long production cycle in game development -Work from home because of Covid ( going back to office soon ) -Ca n't hire all best talent for the studio , also partially due to Covid 
it feel like your are in sale team that you have to achieve daily traget 
Release date can get really hectic and busy

No work life balance 
You are expected to do 15 hour shift , weekend work and anything else that is needed for project delivery 
I 'm a best designer but cause of game development I ca n't give time to my family 
So I left that company

Bad work life balance , no time for self 
lot of work , cyclical release 
First year vacation plan is non existant 
No exposure No work-life balance Work pressure 
Too laid back 
As your domain will be gaming it will be very difficult for you to switch and you will be tied here for year ( again bonded labour ) 
Not flexible on hour and vacation 
-Ubi lean heavily on to co-dev , so you need to be sure that you are happy to work often with team member around the world ( not necessarily an issue , but can be more difficult for some people ) 
The Romanian to expat ratio at Ubisoft Bucharest is very low and many expat are leaving a of 2020 , with very few new one joining it seems 
If you want a really strict work environnement , this is maybe not the best place for you 
not so good deadline and extra hour of working 
Work can get quite franctic sometimes , and sometimes people have to work overtime , but it 's not often and it is usually during important deadline 
Most of the team are doing PC porting and a very little of game development 
Fun can take over seriousness 
Stressful and the schedule is average Nothing else 
> leave structure and timing are REALLY stricy , > bad canteen food , u eat it , u will get bad stomach : -P 
Not much work to do except for test and rate game 
Too much corporate politics but most of the time you can stay outside if you want 
No good restaurant around the office 
Too many project in a short span of time 
No work from home option 
Not the studio fault but it 's expensive to live in the city but there is n't much of an option if you do n't want to commute back and forth every day 
Sometimes , le and le now , you do have intense crunch time 
Management , business first health and employee second 
A lot of work at time 
* Not a great work/life balance 
This can be frustrating , especially if you are working in central function such a IT 
If you want to stay creative stay away 
No con in work life 
Stress and toxicity do occur within the team but that 's subjective 
Mismanagement of game & people , therefore multiple delay time and time again 
Co-dev with other studio sometimes is not the best experience you will have in your life 
Work/life balance is n't brilliant 
Overtime is implied for every project , no work life balance 
-Some people just do only the minimum for their job or do n't do their 8h per day 
No work life balance

low salary work labour tight schedule le appreciative 
If you walked in there you wouldnt know it wa a game studio at all 
) and it extremely frustrating for developer to have to deliver bi-weekly/ monthly build to a company and then they bombard you with a ton of feedback all at once 
You start loving your job so much you can forget to go home 
Codev lead focusing for major demo can mean you might not be able to work at full capacity or get help unless your stuff is in a demo 
Not a lot of parking around the studio 
We could say that the open space is not very plaisant a a working environment , very noisy 
No con just you have to be passionate about your work 
It can be long hour due to doing midnight launch etc 
A job too easy that gradually I burnt out 
The other side , the bad side of leaving office at 5pm is that you come to the office at 9am 
Even worse , it becomes 8am when daylight saving turn on in Europe and America , ( though you leave office at 4pm ) 
No work from home option 
The relationship between the editorial team and the studio could be better and save everyone some precious time and energy 
limited rest time , leader are like spy , check employee working time 
A lot of people doing NOTHING ! but youtube everyday They are hiring ton of people but project are still finished last minute , bad organization in general , communication suck between people and between other country in general 
Office is far away in the mile-end , not convenient at all 
shift time 
not payed very well , sometimes stressfll work , 
every day is a very busy one 
Lack of internal competition spirit 
Very politics driven team : a lot of you pat my back so I 'll pat yours 
No work-life balance 
Not enough parking lot 
Work/Life balance not that great 
once I wa told to play on two device at the same time and find bug and it wa also not a request , they even bring that point out in performance review 
Ubisoft Toronto is best if you do n't have a family ! Montreal want to dictate process and protocol 
Perfect for a summer job for a highschool teen 
Air cooling solution are not enough for the amount of worker 
Your work impact is very low 
You do n't get to work on the important part of the game , only leftover 
Work is demanding in term of time commitment but le so in brain power Perceived `` French wall '' to career progression 
And the period between project 
The work is n't balanced all over the year 
Too far , too few , too little 
It will be hard because still there no Certificate and i must complete my study in case if they throw me out 
workload can be a bit heavy at time but typical for a growing company 
Work life balance is still not where it should be at the end of project 
Poor organization that implied a lot of extra hour and poor final quality 
Very poor salary , a lot of people very sick and tired to work there 
while I understand the company ha changed since I worked there a management turned over , at the time I wa there it wa a battle of ego where the lower echelon of the company were the one who suffered by losing their job or being overworked 
like every weekend 
Tons of work ! Working wa so hard that I usually caught myself sleeping 
Life a a tester suck bad , low salary , plenty of overtime hour to work when release date is approaching and not that much of a compensation 
My immediate supervisor wa more interested in her fake nail than my well being 
At the time my dad wa terminally ill and did not want to accommodate my leaving the office earlier to take care of him 
Apart from the high season , workload sometimes is extremely low 
You 're either bored out of your mind between project or overworked trying to meet deadline for E3 , cert , patch , or whatever 
Can be challenging when it come to time zone collaboration 
I 've had project I 've worked very hard on then got canceled at the last minute because they took too long 
They will tell you `` well you have n't really done anything important here yet '' You 're doing the best you can , but others do n't respond to your email , or doing their job and you end taking more and more task to fill up your time and then you end up in a situation where you 're constantly juggling complex task 
No one actually care if you are happy and productive ( a good thing if you do n't care either ) 
Sometimes project have to be finished in a certain period leaving you with a lot of overtime and life-work balance becomes some what non-existant 
Also , people just get lifted from the project they are invested in to work on other project that are reaching their deadline , sometimes there even is no work for them and they sit there doing nothing until someone in management figure out there 's nothing to do for the guy and he 's sent back to his old team , who now is also behind on schedule and the whole circus start again

Perhaps unbeknownst to them , Ubi-lifers ( 20+ yr with the company ) , Senior VPs , and others close to the top have pushed many FTEs on the publishing side into a ~ 9-month period of ambiguity

Executive management doe n't seem to know the direction they want to take and how to lead the ground troop ( or doe n't communicate it well ) 
My lead and upper management wanted me to fail by not revealing to me issue they had with me and my work until the project wa over 
-Some lead JUST DO N'T COMMUNICATE with their team 
I told my lead about it and he told me it wa no big deal and to ignore it 
Sometimes the leadership can be a bit too involved in small decision 
the marketing team saw a recent mass exodus , yet a senior member sent a demoralizing email out to the remaining team basically labeling the departed employee a unable to cut it -Unrealistic expectation and no support -Terrible managing of team member 
Upper management disconnected from team dynamic 
If you are a high performer , you 'll be amazed to see a lot of director and senior manager are stuffed with fluff , buzzword and can be absolute diva 
leadership team ha been there a long time without any change , multiple team do the same work , inefficient , very political environment 
One friend of mine wa actually told by her VP that due to the high turnover of her boss they could n't evaluate her properly , that this wa n't anyone 's fault but unfortunately , they needed to review her again 
Lots of upper management that sit back and watch everyone else do the hard work 
Sometimes hard to communicate with upper management 
The same people have been in management position for 15 year due to seniority or favoritism and they are not good leader 
Business is stuck with many manual process Leadership is often family or friend or people who are groomed for a role Not very effective development program for all employee 
Several top manager have grown from inside the organization and so have no understanding of different business technique or strategy beyond what they themselves have implemented 
Further , some mid to top level manager struggle with managing people and have had neither the necessary training nor the role modeling they need to be truly effective leader 
All major decision are made in Paris and senior management doe not know strategic objective 
Top management is completely out of touch with their own organization 
Most senior and tenured team member have gathered themselves into passive aggressive clique 
My direct manager wa consistently away or absent and had little to no knowledge of event taking place with his team and provided zero support , instead he wa often found swiping on tinder during meeting 
Too much politics in higher managemant 
Some lead do not care about their employee and fail your trust 
upper management on game project are disillusioned 
High-budget project had to stand under the thumb of HQ 
everything take time , blurry strategy from top management 
As others have mentioned , the biggest con is the lack of vision from upper management

Not paying the top money 
Their game are not doing anything particularly new or innovating It ( still ) ha horrible people in management and leadership position 
Orwellian level of gaslighting from the managers/directors , their own shortcoming and mistake will never be acknowledged and their impact greatly diminished 
Directors are most probably sociopath Regarding Ubisoft : 
Salary a bit below the market Bad top management 
Politics on upper management , some narrow-minded leaders/directors 
Messy top management 
the people , upper management , the coffee 
The problem the studio ha is that it 's management team ha people who have been around for a long time and stopped doing the type of work that the people they manage do and thus have sometimes highly unrealistic expectation , especially in the world building department 
bad monetary growth bad upper management they can replace you easily 
Managing director and his right hand man is taking turning tormenting their employee

Overtime , communication from the top management 
Old school management ( not startup culture ) 
Mafia type grip on upper level position No talent management whatsoever No risk taking to promote junior Poor pay Company currently losing itself in everything but how to make great game 
For instance I saw a manager furiously yell at someone until the person started to cry and even then he continued to scream 
The top management seems to be willing to improve it 
High hierarchy structure 
Ubisoft a a company is currently being ( rightfully ) under scrutiny due to the sexual and emotional assault accusation towards higher management 
HR can have discriminatory and exploitative policy or process Director level leadership can be slightly toxic Male dominated French language barrier 
Lots of hierarchy and management layer 
Awful office space ( an ex car parking building ) Very slow decision making from the upper management 
Senior are some time to dominating & give you more pressure 
There may be politics at the upper level 
Ridiculously awful upper management 
Incompetent C-level manager ; Loads of office politics ; Abusive short contract ; Low salary ; Lengthy working hour

Every project ha awesome idea but then the upper management tell them to stop , do it their way or stop working 
Few manager and Leads are racist 
The heavy-layered management hierarchy can impact the progress on some project and create frustration 
Very strict management hirarchy 
It ’ s a huge company si process and a lot of management level can be a bit heavy 
The company is in the majority lead by the same people who founded and built it 30+ year ago 
It ha some good aspect to it , but a lot of executive / C-level manager are slightly out of touch with the industry , and quite reluctant to embrace necessary change , being too busy defending their established rôle 
Upper management is awfully oblivious of what 's going on in the development side so they make whimsical choice that end up hindering the team 
Upper management doe n't value knowledge of the product and totally disregard motivation and showing effort 
The Team Leads are NOT great open and respectful person 
Huge disconnect between upper management and frontline staff 
Untrustworthy Senior management 
Many lead , product manager , and senior designer to make ambitious plan 
Leadership and Production management are generally incompetent 
Work get redone and redone because leadership rarely ha any idea on what work actually get done because they are more interested in PowerPoint presentation than actual technical or production competency 
Lots of politics and Toxic leadership 
boy club still exist at top hierarchy of production 
The new MD is an authority figure and want only follower 
Those who follows are pet ( usually the incompetent ) and that 's happening from very senior people down to lead 
Weird that there are a lot of director getting fat salary actually do n't get fired 
Managers and lead have a Holier than thou attitude and not willing to share or teach the software ( I will say though that the occasional two minute tutorial that they did give where mind-blowingly pointless and served no purpose 
Upper management only want to follow trend and recycle proven formula instead of trying to innovate 
Toxic leadership 
Senior leader are blindly worshipped by team of fawning sycophant 
Very political hiearchy : you wo n't find a lot of director/leads that got their position solely based on their skill 
Top Management can be a bit too defensive at time Questionable top line decision Too many thing to announce/revise/plan at once Jack of all trade , master of none 
-Offensive , disrespectful people in leading position 
-Shady management people in the mobile department in the top that literally nobody in the studio appreciate 
-CEO assumes control of area he ha no expertise on ( creative direction , game design , etc 
Some key decision are made by management and not the team 
Lots of « politics » at the higher level management of the different team 
The manager are not impartial sometimes 
If you are a senior , they will do everything to find something to blame you 
Unclear direction on game strategy which often led to conflicting priority Senior Management had trouble acknowledging ownership or committing to new direction Very top-down or laissez-faire style by leader which prevented honest conversation about problem Lack of coordination across function due poor organizational design Inadequate leadership time & attention given to talent issue ( usually ignored or dismissed ) Employees feared of telling the senior team about honest inquiry or opinion 
Overtime , lack of vision from upper management , lack of communication between developing site , lot of feature dropped just before release 
The main con lie within the top management , to be precise 
As the average age of a person in the upper management is quite le , there may not be some wise act overall 
You never know why a decision ha been made by top management 
stagnant management ( most have never work anywhere else in the industry ) , executive management all related by family or friendship to the owner 
compensation not up to to industry standard higher management lack willingness to explore 
Most of the people at the top making the big decision are only really good at regurgitating marketing spiel and have no applicable or useful development knowledge 
Very hierarchical authority model outside of production 
Worst lead and manager 
top management need to understand the country specific need 
Salary is too low Higher level management is poor 
Communication between top level management is poor 
Studio vision directed by HQ 
Some of the direct manager are rude 
As I understand it , the problem is more with certain manager etc 
Heirarchies ( Hard to get thing done ) 
Top management can be rigid Manager might not always review your work Sometimes no legitimate instruction are given 
Large of often loud open space , with no apparent concern from top management about the noise issue 
Senior management is dumb and unprofessional 
Upper Management hell 
Ask yourself ; how many of the GRP project manager , producer and game devs still remain in the studio ? These were guy that worked 16 hour day 
The studio 's GRP-hardened veteran 
The manager giving harassment had a years-long record of harassment within the company , however , HR did nothing to solve the problem and willingly allowed numerous employee be abused 
The leadership is extremely cliquish and exclusive club 
Head office control all and change to the game cause turmoil 
Old team with old idea still run the show 
Lack of pushing the standard with certain aspect of development because the studio exec want it to be a specific way 
[LISTSEP]
Long hour , highly performance driven 
You 're replaceable , you need to do more than work hard to be recognized 
Career growth and advancement is slow Environment is toxic 
Low opportunity for real growth 
You can work your butt off to get a higher position for very little pay off in term of pay raise 
Most of the higher position up from a basic support agent have more responsibility but very little increased pay 
Its best to get what you can out of the job and then move on a soon a you get a better opportunity 
None so far love working for Ubisoft 
Management play favorite and only provides career advancement to those who are willing to play their game 
90 % if not more of this job is copy 
As a temporary agent , you will be worked extensively , with no set schedule , and will be lied to about your career advancement with this company 
All of the knowledgeable and experienced agent are forced out and replaced with undertrained new people 
Career progression Total Compensation ( no RSUs at least at the Analyst level ) Internal transfer are difficult 
Lack of growth opportunity 
If you can make a decent wage somewhere else , I highly recommend to not apply because you will regret quitting your job for this 
I have seen thousand of people come and go , some were fired and most left before they get fired 
A lot of temporary employment 
The whole office doe n't trust the incompetent HR team especially when you hear what 's happened to various people leading them to quit 
Nepotism is rampant in this office in various team 
People who should have been fired or never even hired in the first place are kept on and usually promoted because they are friend with people from above 
High turnover a a result 
low salary compared to the market 
Low performing employee will be given opportunity to prove themselves valuable in whatever small capacity 
However , low performing employee who manage to stick around for a long time may end up being promoted by default , resulting in incompetent people in leadership or management position 
Catered to someone with an experienced technical background , but definitely not towards the 16 year old just wanting to play their game 
I did n't even get an in person interview 
And maybe after they do they to you a few time , they MIGHT hire you on directly instead of through a staffing agency 
-Career minded customer service agent are squeezed out 
They just wa n't button pressers , not intelligent career minded individual 
No room for career growth 
I wa unfortunately a part of the Dev side 
Jobs can become much larger than your initial expectation , and you do n't necessarily get the recognition you 'd expect at maybe another employer , a soon a you might expect 
Unless you 're willing to relocate , your advancement potential is limited 
High turnover ( even for the bay area ) 
The way budget get spent is strange , a lot of poorly guided decision regarding promotion , assignment of larger task to the wrong people , and little support for individual growth 
Compensation and job advancement opportunity were lacking 
Limited opportunity for career advancement once you progress to a certain level 
few opportunity for vertical promotion , compensation way below market price 
Promotions seem to get handed out randomly 
They leave only to get a better job that 's the equivalent of 1 or 2 promotion with a nice salary increase 
She left for a way better opportunity 
It 's rare for contractor to get hired on full time and many of the contractor that I knew felt like outsider 
The Sales , Digital Marketing , PR , pretty much every team except for maybe Community and the Sales Analysts are at all versed in game , or show any respect for game a anything more than a sale number 
The Recruitment effort have n't changed so more and more people who do n't know game nor care about game are hired 
Not great opportunity for advancement 
However , Ubisoft is n't the greatest when it come to promoting their employee 
people will deliver consistently great work and they still have to prove themselves to get a promotion 
You 'll hear reason for being rejected for a promotion like , `` You 're too hard core to work on this more casual title 
`` Seriously ? Ubisoft 's habit of doing this mean that many employee leave for other company to prove themselves and then return to Ubisoft ; meaning that it 's a great training ground but if you want to work in a position your skill set is best suited for then you 'll likely have to leave to achieve it 
It 's a shame that they do n't seem see the value in their talent , but other company most definitely will , and they 'll pay better to boot 
During my personal time at Ubisoft i wa rejected for a promotion more than once 
I left and I 'm doing the same exact job that I wa turned down for at Ubisoft , and I 'm willing to bet dollar to doughnut that I make more where I am now then I would have doing the same thing at Ubisoft 
Working there felt like a popularity contest all the time 
Not much room for growth if you are looking to join SF based IT department 
I wa so lucky to be a contractor and have a great Creative Director 
Ok place to work for 
No upward mobility past Director level 
For some , it may seem difficult to move up the ladder 
Regarding promotion and time-off policy , there is some weirdness there 
Loses talented young developer to competitor 
Our best people leave for new position because of pay and few career opportunity 
HR is a joke , they do not follow policy that are put into place to protect an employee -There is no mentoring to help people in their dream job -Mangers do not do their job , push the work on the people underneath them , then complain when it is not completed -They say their is a college reimbursement program , but not one person who signed up for it ha gotten it -They choose to play hardball with studio that are part of the same publisher when thing are not going their way -There is no way to get out of a position into another one -Secretive about everything , they do not share thing with the employee , used to be very open -They allow racist comment towards other employee in front of HR , nothing wa done -Ideas on how to improve work flow are stolen from the employee and no credit is given to them , saw this numerous time -HR is hardly around , doe n't understand geek and nerd culture , always talk down to you -Not allowed to really leave your desk or take a break with out HR and Mangers flipping out 
Upperward growth past a `` director '' level on the commercial side is difficult a there is just nowhere to go 
Senior team member rarely move out of the company 
Despite these issue , it is a phenomenal place and industry to work in with more upside than down 
Anyone who is n't French probably doe n't have a great chance of reaching the highest level in the company 
You can even participate in the creation of world-famous game IPs 
Not supporting genuine people to move ahead 
No career growth Very low salary OT is rampant 
Lack of comunication between department No real chance of advancement outside QC No real upward visibility in term of 
* Higher management * Compensation * Career growth 
Low to average salary compared to normal tech firm Progression can be challenging after many year 
It take year to get higher in your job 
No salary hike Slow promotion policy Favouritism by lead 
Less Salary Hike Slow Growth Repetitive Work Less Career Growth Less Internal Opportunity 
some people are getting promoted for being friend with the management 
High turnover 
Most of the talent left 
Career progression is not very clear 
The studio lost almost all it lead within a year ( Design , QA , Brand , Operations , Community , Support , QA , Programming , etc 
There are amazing people who work in this studio , but they are pushed down and held back 
* Low salary * No recognition * Bad management * Only manager favorite get quick promotion here 
They do n't give the opportunity to work from other country 
Salary is low and career growth is low 
management hard to work with -cross-team coordination is very poor -very hard to move up/around if you do n't know French -no WFH allowance for equipment/utilities during covid 
Low salary Limited career growth 
Increasing seniority is difficult a they work in a very flat structure which mean generating higher pay is more limited 
You want to get a promotion ? No skill needed , just good friend 
Extremely low salary No financial investment from the company towards existing talent 
difficult to progress , HR a bit stiff on title and mandate 
Search online for worker right in UAE 
Low pay and hard to progress 
Some of the job profile like mine ha hectic night shift 
I forgot the number of people who told me that to evolve at Ubisoft , you need to leave and come back in a higher role 
Slow in term of career growth 
compensation -very political environment -no career path : the objective and expectation are the same for a junior and a senior / there is no mobility process 
Also not the biggest tech/game hub in Vietnam , so it is suffering from a lack of native devs 
Internal mobility & promotion are difficult to have 
Turnover is high 
Low junior salary for the city Hard to raise in rank after the junior stage Hard to be noticed when you give 110 % by the higher-up , not your immediate manager 
salary , job advancing , no training , no course 
You 're forced to change studio if you want to progress 
You 're going to be stressed a hell for 18 month while you wait to find out if they will renew you for a CDI contract 
Promotions are handed out in this order : French ( from France ) , French ( from Quebec ) , and lastly Anglophones 
No choice on what project you get to work on 
Salary disparity between junior and intermediate position is huge 
People leaving every week , leading to experienced junior teaching newer people with higher pay grade 
Working for such a large company mean thing tend to move a bit slower than at small company 
very political , which cause bad management in some group -not much direction in career growth 
Not a meritocracy , expect a formal org chart with a standard hierarchy 
Top three Con ( in particular order ) 1 ) management lack vision 2 ) horrible performance review system 3 ) lacking in career development 
But , salary increase are low a is internal promotion which is mostly not managed ( you have to do it all by yourself ) and their is a lack of detection of AAA talent 
Experience varies greatly from project to project & department to department 
hard to get promoted 
Managers from hell , aka the programmer who don ’ t want to be programmer 
Company matter the most , people not so much 
Very political and late in term of work environment 
Job switching between the study is difficult due to local HR policy 
Lot of outsourced work studio working style due which le exposure 
Little room for advancement Limited experience gain 
a lot of talented people are leaving the company 
low salary , lack of creative chance 
Megacorporation bad for a career 
Little to no opportunity for growth a a game tester 
salary and new opportunity at this company 
The pay structure is not the same and offer le salary for promotion 
Headhunters can easily poach senior talent because of this 
Very slow working up the rank , with very small raise year by year 
Less growth in career Bad compensation 
low salary , hard developing opportunity 
not much career upgrade opportunity 
Getting increment is bit difficult in the company 
Even 1 year experienced software engineer have to start from fresher ' level 
Low salary regarding the market 
Low salary for some job 
slow promotion compared to other tech company 
You can make more money somewhere else 
Low base salary French privilege Not much opportunity for innovation Too many middle management , upon whom you depend for your career growth 
High turnover 
no WFH availlable full time 
Slow reaction to management issue If your superior doe n't push for advancement , stalling with low salary increase is commonplace 
Game dev is generally hard and you will need unlimited passion to burn 
room for growth is le , fierce competition 
The pro I listed vary from team to team 
Low salary a compared to IT market Less/No External Technical training 
Hard to move within the organization 
If you 're an ambitious individual , forget about climbing the corporate ladder if you are n't French ( or French Canadian , top ) 
If you 're really lucky you could get to be lead , but it is very probable that you will get to be a senior after 3 year and that 's it ( exactly 3 , a performance doe n't really count in promotion , only time ) 
Incompetent internal talent management team 
there are no con for this job place 
The career path is not clear 
High turnover 
A lot of management are just not qualified and nobody know how they got those position in a first place 
Studio is growing so fast ( bad and good thing ) 
Slow policy for promotion 
Also , everyone I know whom worked at Ubisoft ha either already left or is in the process of leaving 
Almost impossible to get a raise 
Ubisoft India studio ha le possibility for growth for Research and Development Engineers a most of the important research and recognition is based out of India 
I am ashamed of having had worked at Ubisoft 
I witnessed and experienced coordinated harassment , and most of the abuser were promoted ! 
Everyone I know whom is still working at Ubisoft are actively looking for work elsewhere 
It ’ s very hard to be fast tracked , even when you are a top talent 
Which lead to a strong churn rate around 5-6 year of experience 
Basically , Ubi is a great place to learn and to come back 10 year later with a VP/Director salary 
As well a last year policy to hire and promote with stress on the social skill left a big dent in the company efficiency and competitiveness 
Lack of progression 
no promotion unless you are a good friend of the top management , and with story we heard 
Director Roles Not always the recognition for every studio involved 
Working on game of AAA scale is n't for everyone 
Work for an internal team 
I think Ubi know people have deep interest in working at the company and are willing to do it for the resume 
Ubi is a good resume builder a it is a very recognizable brand 
Best talent can leave unexpectedly 
Not much if love gaming then it 's good option a pay is little le but in gaming it 's like that 
Appraisal and growth are very limited 
HR related work are very slow 
High turnover due to project finishing scandal and aggressive poaching 
Designers are scribe and coordinator more than creatives , even on the `` small '' team Lack of training and support for lead 
hard to grow outside management 
little / no opportunity to grow within the company 
Not enough stable work in Narrative Design in the long term 
Poor Compensation , HR Dominance , Internal Mobility Policies , Corporate Politics 
Low salary , No remote work , mostly Juniors no enough Seniors 
HR and Recruitment know this 
They know there 's a constant supply of idealistic young people who look starry-eyed at UBISOFT and will send in their CVs 
Unless you have a hard requirement to work in the gaming industry and you have no other option , do n't come work here 
Salaries are low , and it 's hard to advance 
Career ceiling is quite low for most 
Very bad recruitment procedure 
The job posting v 
Why some game testing job are great , and why others are kinda terrible How you can specifically avoid the drawback that other tester have to deal with every day Why game testing is a rewarding job and a great way to start your career in game 
Any leaving employee are being replaced with people who cost le with lower title 
Need a little more detail about career and salary grown inside the company 
Casual sexism/racism/power harassment that will go unchecked -a lot of bureaucracy -impossible to make your mark -low pay 
There is no possibility to grow in term of salary and responsibility 
Hard to level up if you change manager often Lots of ego 
no collage open no salary like corona 
you need to fight for salary 
Being in AAA title development mean they rely on the job appeal more than having high remuneration 
indefinite contract is offered after at least 2 year in the company 
Office politics , nepotism , retaliation , etc 
Senior levels/skills were too spread out 
lower salary , inhouse competitivity for talent 
Not many opportunity for growth , salary 
Almost lowest salary offer in the country ( for game industry ) 
Despicable career progression 
`` You already have 2 year of experience ? Great , you start from 0 again ; see you in 2-3 year for a promotion '' Promotion is done only after performance review ( which is yearly ) , and you might be lucky* enough to be promised the promotion 6 month earlier , and then actually not get promoted for no good reason 
) Moreover , if you do n't join the meme club and do some fake flattery , your chance of promotion ( and well-being ) are significantly diminished 
Salary is low in gaming field at least in INDIA however , you can grow in it by putting effort 
Many people leaving ( everyone going to Sharkmob , IO interactive , etc ) 
Ongoing HR re-organisation 
career opportunity is limited if you do not develop game 
Lack of diversity Toxic work environment Decisions are often “ office politics based ” Low pay Lack of “ real ” career progression 
everyone get promoted at the end of the financial year without actual change to their job or responsibility 
None ? I can easily see myself doing my entire career there 
That 's how much I like my place here , my past growth within the company and my potential for growth ' 
Constant scope change , chasing a moving target 
Enterprise feeling , Friendship with Eve ( better family tie ) is a key factor to have a managing role for a regional office , that mean that person could do almost anything ( in term of managing ) and not lose the job , until he or she is a friend or a family member , which lead the management level to be low 
Politics while promotion 
It 's been 2 year working there and I still have n't found any con 
Low pay , communication issue and low mobility option 
Low salary Few opportunity to advance 
Low salary Less opportunity for growth 
Low Pay scale , Clarity of Work 
Few development opportinites Mediocre salary against competitor 
Full time contract are scarce 
middle management , no progression , poor pay 
Long hour , hard for growth opportunity

work politics 
high employee turnover 
Less salary and growth opportunity is also le because of old employee who have been in company for more that 5-10 year they do n't want to grow a they are safe at there current position have good salary and get atleast 10 % increment per-year with hardly doing any work , they dont even know the difference between NAT type and send ALL GOOD for network testing , most of them do n't know how to test game on X-box , Play-station , switch , and different application on PC 
Work culture , salary , work process , communication , сlass discrimination , sex discrimination , nepotism 
Title/Career 
Need more Human Resources people 
Low salary , complicated procedure , long waiting period to grow a career or role upgrade 
Lower than average pay Lots of competition to move upward 
Nothing a bad because it a good company to start you journey in gaming industry 
Cool place to work 
Compensations and chance of promotion require update 
Salary increment and career growth problem 
And if your manager is not into developing you , good luck working on your fixed duty for year without promotion or new opportunity 
For that reason there 's little opportunity for challenge/proffesional 
Low Salary , management behaviour HR role 
Minimum wage , some of the manager were n't really suited for their position 
Salary below market , slow career progression 
Starting company Some process are not yet solid and are not yet familiar to people 
Low Salary , Management , No OTs , politics , policy 
low salary for anyone not caucasian , lot of politics , gossip and power play 
Will often hire externally instead of promote 
Management , growth within the studio 
also once you start with a title you are sort of stuck with it for a few year before getting a chance to go up the heirarchy 
Less salary for junior game tester 
Outside Ubisoft I 've never work for a company that tolerate those behaviour and even le promote those individual to higher position 
There are plenty of better company in Montreal 
Small team in Sydney and not a lot of turnover so career opportunity can be limited 
not a good company to grow with 
poor facility Do n't think of promotion 
doe n't seem to be ton in the way of a ladder to work up to in QC alone , they more or le expect you to learn skill in a different category like programmer or artist or etc 
He is a producer , game designer , programmer , UI artist , and QA 
Staff turnover : a lot of people left 
No Cons , Salary Increments , Senior Game Testers Recruitment should be there 
Looks to have bias to be french speaking in order to climb up the ladder 
Not really focused on employee growth 
Both in data , programming , marketing and game design 
Career progression for programmer lean heavily to either becoming `` gameplay '' , `` AI '' or `` generalist '' programmer : other path , even though dearly necessary for the project , are not encouraged by producer ( due to alleged difficulty in acquiring mandate for project in these other path ) ; 
French structure No possibility of moving Up quickly Scarce opportunity Middle management through the roof Toxic culture 
No career path 
Less salary , no hike , no promotion , le growth 
Dont stay long if you are looking for growth 
Should hire more in their studio 
Hiring based on affiliation to other institution hamper the quality of the workforce a well 
Limited advancement , lateral or upward , some questionable leadership , too much red tape to move idea around , too much control from Ubi HQ 
1 ) Getting promotion is dependent upon the amount of year spent in the studio along with performance 
you can easily get cought in too much job 
limited growth in industry due to le knowledge 
Difficult to grow professionally 
employ people with no experience 
Slow Promotion and salary rate 
Leadership is sorely lacking and the sexual misconduct and abusive power structure need to be torn down 
Nice place to work 
HR is non-existent 
toxic management , few opportunity for growth if not friend with the upper management 
Nepotism , backstabbing , low pay , inexperienced people on managing position 
If you are joining to make career in game then yes , if not then no 
Low salary , no carrier , management 
Internal Department switch is hard to get 
Micromanagement , limited development opportunity , office could use renovation 
I wa n't directly hired by Ubisoft but by Artefacts ( indie studio ) 
Political , upward mobility is limited for non-French 
Very slow career growth 
Glass ceiling in the company if youre not a french speaker or national 
Very low salary for a software engineer , year spent in the company are more important than how competent the employee is , leading to not having a very high bar in senior/management role 
Not so many level of seniority in role can mean that you are in the same position for a long time ( at least for production ) 
They should try to give better promotion to high performing individual to keep them at the company 
Ubisoft know they treat their employee with job security better than other company 
art , programming , testing , you name it 
The studio constantly bleeds top tier talent because of this 
There are some HR Talent Acquisition specialist who are very unprofessional 
-Career path , be weary 
if you are n't given an idea where you are headed in the interview , chance are you will be stuck in a stagnant job opportunity 
Too many high level job that are not vital to production and are sometimes disconnected to the developer 
give a lot of temporary contract with waiting period whereas people and job are the same ( it 's illegal in France actually ) 
doe n't offer enough training and learning tied to specific job 
very good to work with game developer 
Salary and growth , zero to none 
Management wa unqualified 
Salaries are not competitive and is difficult to find long term growth within the Marketing team 
Very effective and skill development 
advancement/career opportunity exist but it is very difficult to access them ; employee are n't really supported to change team ; 
Beware though , the said politics may stay in your way if you 're expecting advancement 
Incompetent people are promoted constantly 
Inter-studio conflict , management politics , HR , lead position tend to be filled with folk with little to no leadership experience 
Lots of project and initiative are killed because some people 'are not comfortable ' with them , and in some area of the organization , dissonant voice can quickly result in career stagnation 
Ubisoft is a great company for Juniors to start their career , gain a lot of experience and opportunity , but typically struggle to keep it super talented and promising expert with ~5 year of experience in the company 
Low Salary Such a huge company , low opportunity to progress your career further 
lower pay than competitor , not much chance to develop and grow , long time between project without something to work on , no work from home availability 
Lack of quality hire 
Promotions are rare , and salary review are not fair 
There 's actually a very bad ambience in the studio due to these situation ( low salary , late promotion , project with low-quality mandate , etc ) 
Promotions are rare 
Being a member of close to 4000 employee , it 's not easy to grow in your career or rise in your rank 
Market themselves a allowing growth , but there 's a high employee turnover rate 
If you are a junior , it 's a great way to ship your first title 
Do n't fall for the trap of getting too comfy here if you want to grow in your career 
If you 're looking to work at a factory-like environment making the same game over and over it 's a good place to learn the industry 
Be careful exploring new role there 
You ca n't go back to a previous role 
middle salary very low career opportunity 
Lack of Career Growth Opportunities 
Not the right studio to look for a stable future 
Low Salary , growth is not too fast 
Management is an issue , and growing is becomes difficult 
Do n't expect to progress your career here unless if you have good connection to management 
Starting salary are very low 
If you want to earn more and progress career you will have to leave the company and come back 
Very low pay and badly managed , co-development is hell 
Very high turnover 
Low salary , low recognition , no vision , micromanagement , oligarchy instead of meritocracy 
Being french is a must if you want ( the few if any ) promotion 
Low salary Hard to make a career 
Low seniority level because experienced employee leave a soon a do n't receive recognition inside the company 
Most of technical manager did not know anything about web devlopment 
At the moment not much room for career growth , but might change in the future since the office is growing every year 
All the good people i worked with left ubisoft for an other studio 
Forget it , you ca n't evolve UNLESS you have friend that have high position such a director and producer 
– Management do n't care about your interest and the skill you 'd like to develop 
Funny Right ! ! 7 ) Except the game enthusiast most of the people leave this company within a year 
I haven ’ t worked there yet 
The growth is very very slow ( salary wise and promotion due to tough competition ) 3 
People who have experience in a different area , I would advise sticking with IT or any other industry 
I will give 2 year in this company after that it seems pointless 
Micromanagement , co-dev doe n't work at Ubisoft , low salary , bad ambience for creative person , studio direction is completely disconnected from reality and they do n't care about worker 
Becoming larger make role become more specialized 
local tend to get bypassed in management/leadership role unless you get into their clique 
Salary isn ’ t a high a I could get elsewhere 
There ’ s a “ French glass ceiling ” , I managed to be proficient in French in my first year , review with flying colour , I wa on lead of several initiative in my previous team over the year , but promotion are hard to obtain since non native are often regarded good a leader in several group 
Not good for : innovator , intermediate to senior people looking to expand their skill set or become more efficient 
The remaining are then sometimes promoted to leadership position due to seniority , which cause the cycle to repeat and escalate 
Definitely some nepotism at play when it come to leadership role 
Poor HR management 
They prefer to employ people from outside than promote talent from inside 
Hard to escalate the professional ladder 
Not clear path to promotion 
Hierarchy driven Initiative is discouraged Dodgy practice to avoid permanent hire and high turnover Redundancy in some management and creative position No training for staff below 2 year XP Low salary for design-related position 
Hard to escalate the professional ladder ; too political ; team are like tribe that compete against each other ; being versatile is under-valued compared to knowing 1 thing deeply 
Promotions at Ubisoft Barcelona are like unicorn , and if you are promoted it doe n't mean you will have a salary increasement 
They use internship people for testing while killing their professional expectation and career 
There are no career opportunity provided to grow 
Nothing to learn Low salary Less Carrier opportunity 
Low pay Difficult to advance Slow in implementing change 
Leadership is top down order driven le you incur the wrath of management and your career is stalled because they don ’ t like you 
Promotion process is more a popularity contest on who ha the best rumor about you 
Is it any wonder the turnover for senior developer is so high 
The rest can find more fulfilling work elsewhere 
Most skilled and talented worker are moving to other company 
not a lot of opportunity to evolve and get another position 
-management is not really good at helping career growth 
Wants to brand himself a a `` hero '' but never had that capability to manage a company 
HR is genuinely a great team but lack much empowerment 
This company is losing a lot of local talent in the past year 
Wants to a leading tech company but lack comp , culture and senior people who can innovate 
Some junior manager need a bit of seasoning 
Month and a half to finish whole process to get a job 
no training program in place to teach newbie coming on board ( a compared to the Montreal studio that teach animator for example 6 month before they even go on the floor to work on production 
) mis-allocation of talent 
not using the talent of people hired for the right job 
Very very low salary , slow career growth 
Bad management and quite hard to get a promotion if you do n't lick higher ranked lead bottom 
Salary could be higher , sometimes hard to move up the chain to other job 
salary is lower than industry a lot of middle management , not always very competent , like in any tech company that promotes expert in their field that have no actual management skill process and a questionnable company structure make every decision tedious to take with many departement competing for ownership of project because of so many middle management , individual talent are often under-looked or management is not really good at helping career growth 
it is a great company to work 
Stuck doing one thing for month at a time Little to no career advancement Salary increase are minute 
No career development plan 
Promotion process , inter-department politics , job security 
Slow career growth , poor HR management 
No real career development opportunity outside of head office , little opportunity to travel , low pay , almost no labour turnover ( pro and con in some respect ) 
Being so big , it can be hard to get noticed or move forward in your career 
wage are low , low posibilities for evolution in the department 
The rest of the HR team are rude , do not care and do not know how to conduct interview 
I wa asked to go to their office twice a one of the HR member could not attend the interview 
I would not work for them 
Jobs are quite specific and the Tech is complex ( ex : Several game engine , C++ , online 
In my case , they closed the film division I wa working on 
you have got lot of work to do and you will stay in the company for a long long time 
No many possibility for growth fast , too many employee 
I spent 5 year working at Ubisoft Montreal actively trying to get a promotion and raise 
I had clear career goal from the day I wa hired until I walked out the door 
Worst yet , I did n't want to leave but had no other choice due to the low wage and lack of career growth 
Within 2 year at another studio , I wa promoted twice and lead a team of 11 people 
Growth depends on your term with your superior 
Worst part is the notice period for intermediate and Senior tester , 2-3 month 
-Career : Do n't expect to get a promotion , unless you know how to smooth talk your way up there 
You have to wait a long time for a promotion 
Being French is mandatory to get higher in the rank 
Low Salary Favoritism Growth is so slow 
Mentally troubled people in management 
-Very poor management skill and professional skill , people with no proven experience and skill 
little live team expertise Few opportunity for employee growth and training Non-unified HR group which hinders cross team knowledge 
Too many people get promoted or get to the next `` level '' and *then* get lazy after some time 
Reward and career opportunity come with seniority 
Full of people who have never worked either anywhere else or only in the same industry 
Unqualified people in high place only because of tenure 
salary , few possibility of growing within the company 
Unfortunately it seems like the best path to a promotion , is so leave and join a competitor for 6 
Talent is not retained or appreciated 4 
So le working pressure for graduators to develop career 
the only good reason to go work there is if you are a junior and want to add some big title to your portfolio before moving somewhere else ( because you will ) 
I worked at different Ubisoft studio on 3 continent , and this is by far the worst of them 
Not enough possibility to grow and develop an career 
management politics and so on and so forth 
Management 
Terrible project at the studio Many wannabe manager / ladder climber on best franchise Terrible tech on some project , it is a hit or miss , each project is a different universe You might end doing a lot of overtime , and if you do n't , do n't expect any bonus 
Office politics Women are rarely in management role Pay rate are lower than the rest of the industry in Montreal 
Not much room to push boundary and grow a an artist 
If there 's an open position and they can choose between a senior and a internship , they will take the last one 
Limited potential career growth unless willing to relocate 
Too little money Opportunities to promote only after 6-12 month 
It is not easy to move up the ladder 
( based on former employee being reprimanded or wrongfully dismissed ) Observed long-term , loyal employee being overlooked by alliance relationship with Seniors ( French ) Very unclear career development Low salary High turn-over ( 3-5 employee left a month 
Constantly hiring externally 
Makes it very difficult to move up in a production roll 
Managing staff is too young to retire , and recently , production feel like they 're stagnating , and project are becoming bloated 
hard to advance , Seniors usually get pushed into management , so few senior do actual art 
Salary is not up to date with current compeitors , very hard to get promoted , it last a year at least 
Maybe this is the trade off for job security , but it 's still an issue 
Not very many opportunity to switch teams/ project 
Looks at the length of time spent in the company to consider promotion for it employee rather than the actual talent of it employee 
Will let them quit and then simply rehire new people 
there is no con if you enjoy game programming 
Limited opportunity for growth Average salary Crunch time ( but this is normal in game industry I guess ) Corporate environment 
Low pay and even lower chance of reasonably paced advancement 
Promotions are done on favoritism , thusly plenty of the low to mid manangement are unskilled impostor 
Little chance to become a senior without upsetting some of the high profile manager in some capacity and declaed unfit for seniority/ , management 
The Paris studio doe not pay well , and focus heavily on Temporary Contracts , so it 's not very stable work 
little room to evolve postion , little room for career growth 
low salary nd no chance for creating 
Obscure evaluation and promotion rule 
Management is big hit or miss 
Kiss your career goodbye 
Promotion and review are based on relationship and politics 
Most leadership is promoted based on amount of year in company instead of meritocracy 
A lot of clique , if you arent part of it , dont expect to upgrade of your position because they back each other before you even think to apply 
The only career opportunity is to find another job 
Almost 0 job security if you have not been there for year or are on a fixed term contract 
Keep people at junior level position for 4 or more year 
Lack of possibility for career to grow 
A lot of hour , repetitive , little posibility to advance in career 
remote work , average opportunity , interior design 
Not many career opportunity 
Slow promotion 
I 'd recommend working here to anyone 
politics , politics , politics and politics salary too low comparig to the other company 
too much request for overtime -people get promoted only by how many year they have been in ubisoft not their ability 
They 're aware of this and they struggle to attract and maintain senior developer 
Career Progression is extremely slow compared to other company 
There is also a glass ceiling for none-french employee in the company 
Seems the only way to get promoted without waiting an age is to leave , come back then ask for more 
Climbing the rank is highly political , pay is below industry average 
Not a place do develop yourself professionally 
# no growth # no employee development program # very le pay le than $ 200 a month # bullying/politics by management # backstabber friend # people pulling each other 's leg to get ahead # unskillful management 
almost none of them have a management degree they know you have a passion for game and they will exploit you for that 
Ubisoft know gamers/developers come to join them bc of their passion for game and they just exploit them 
Low pay , downgrade rank title , no career path 
Production work ha slowly shifted and leaving the employee with uncertain future in Singapore 
if you 're not part of the 'in crowd ' , your day are not numbered , but you 're unlikely to be considered for any kind of promotion 
Often , they spend age trying to fill a position and then just promote from within 
sure , you get to be a pipeline studio for another studio that actually control the game 
Management is lacking 
Climbing the rank will involve an unhealthy amount of politics 
Many mid-level manager ( team lead , associate producer and producer ) are not really management material and/or are badly trained in leading and helping people 
Too much secrecy concerning project advancement 
You are likely to switch teams/projects fairly often according to need 
low salary , office politics , le growth opportunity , 
Promotion chance are low 
Can be a bit difficult to change role internally 
No career path 
Strong turnover ( the colleague I started with have all but resigned ) 
The job-promotion policy is rather strict given such a dynamic industry 
Low salary -Very low chance of being promoted -People who do get promoted , dont get it because of talent but because of contact -QC lead will treat you like a child -QC lead are not good leader and are only there because of seniority 
Little to no career movement 
The training wa formatted in a way to make the position permanent , but once the project ramped down , people were let go left and right or left on their own to find another project 
No way to build a career a you should be at company more than 10 year to grow 
But they are average in the gaming industry 
A bit hard to advance in your career , small salary , sometimes you have to work 13h/day because of the project ( it 's not compulsory though ) 
Ubisoft ha pretty slow career progression and I believe pay wa lower than market 
employee have little influence in their own upward mobility 
Salary often under market , not ideal for people that prefer working on very small team 
Low salary , Less growth opportunity , Job description and work culture dont match 
Very few opportunity to grow within the company 
low salary , promotion celling , Hard work doe not get noticed 
Co Dev experience is hit or miss 
Because of the amount of people here there is competition between people for the same job on big game 
People at the charge are the one that got hired +10 year ago 
A new employee ( and since they hire over 100-200/year ) doe n't get the change to grow and be appreciated like the one who are leader 
Because of the salary , most people leave after 1-2 year , leaving only a few senior and a LOT of junior 
Extremely hard to get anywhere in your career if you 're not friend with those that have seniority 
Hard to see if you can continue there or begin to search new job 
Career advancement wa slow 
Its getting more political especially if you want to move up 
Too many Junior people promoted very quickly due to all senior leaving 
No possibility to grow a a professional 
this job put me off working in AAA again , or at least for a long time 
Worth looking into this further if you want to work at Ubisoft ( or in video game in general ) 
Rigid role so it 's very difficult to move laterally within the company 
Low salary and hard to advance in the field 
Nobody get fired = low performer are everywhere 
Politics determines your mobility in the rank 
If your French is not great and you 're in management and you 're not great at politics 
Career growth is extremely challenging 
* Totally porting to pc task , no professional and personal development ; * Low salary ; * Low priority studio , no impact on development , no decision making ; * Mostly relaxed atmosphere , lack of unified development process maintained by management ; * Overall frustration of team , no focus on getting job done 
I started from bottom , from tester to senior game tester and now currently tool support specialist 
So from QC to Production department in several year 
But thing get a bit better a you get promoted 
Lowest possible salary in Ukraine IT field 
Very competitive environment 
I think that is all , too many people want to apply for these job 
Bureaucracy , if you 're not french then there is no career advancement in ubisoft ( the studio might be different ) 
Most of `` producer '' are just there because they have been sticking long enough , so called `` super star '' creative director tend to be super dick more than anything else 
Go there to put the name on your resumé and leave ASAP 
Like many already mentioned , if you do not speak French then expect never to rise beyond a specific level and jump many more hoop than your French speaking colleague have to a well a your salary might end up in the lower area 
Your career may be blocked by the fact you do not speak French a well 
Possibly because the game industry similar to the film industry always ha enthusiast willing to work for low payment only to be part of it 
While Ubisoft offer ( internal ) course it is up to you to find your path 
If you want to switch position or grow into another field then be prepared to experience a serious lack of support 
There is no clear career path , no career coach , low ( sometimes no ) support from the HR 
alot of time go for working 
The team are mainly too young or unexperimented even the older guy who just reproduce what they have done on the previous project 
As a programmer , prepare to spend a lot of time integrating and merging feature from other project 
Someone who leaf Ubisoft for a year and then come back will almost always have a better position/salary then if they had stayed at Ubisoft 
Slow career progression 
Some producer have double standard when it come to hiring and promotion 
Promotions are not guaranteed , even if you perform above average or excellent 
Low salary at start ; Not much possible progression job wise ; Stressful work 
Salaries under the market because they get ton of hungry people wanting to work for a video game company 
Career development 
HR have no idea on the skill set of the people they hire or continue to manage 
The set back , it would be hard to get to work on those big name big bonus tile , if you not have any `` friend connection '' referral 
No opportunity for career development 
The quality of people ubisoft would hire could be better , which it isnt 
some gap in employee career development 
Salary raise Opportunity to be promoted 
They became human capital investment that actually matured 
They became the new talent base for future projecst 
A lot of function work with various studio and office 
Pay and advancement : There are a lot of little con depending on what you are looking for 
Advancement is also very hard 
You would have to be twice a competent than you would need to be moved up to the next rank , for example junior to regular 
This company just is n't the best place to be at if you 're looking to climb the corporate ladder 
If you 're like me and you want to grow and make a difference , this is n't a good , long term opportunity 
Very few intern are hired for a full-time position after their internship 
In order to succeed in your career , you can only either pull string to be part of the club , learn to speak the same language or else you can only depend on your close ally to hopefully maintain your status quo 
HR is mostly talk and no substantial action 
Competition is strong because you work with lot of talent people 
Very large company to work for 
Lack of training for junior staff 
Career opportunity 
management doe n't care about you , your career or anything related , you are used and then tossed away whenever they feel like it Location 
Now come the HR department 
At ubisoft it hard to get promotion 
Some incapable people work here in high position , looking down at the rest because seniority is decided on how long you work there , not skill 
Also , it seems that non-French speaker are limited at what they can accomplish in the company because some team prefer to keep their inner circle small and 
More staff jockeying for higher positioning than on the project 
This the building with career go to die 
On the flip side , if you 're best buddy with your manager , he can find reason to rally the other manager to his side and give you a promotion 
Some have been promoted this way 
Lack of CTO 
perhaps salary are always below the market and there is always a tendency of recruiting junior people a they are cheaper 
Finding position on the most high profile project can sometimes be an issue of knowing the right person , instead of being the most qualified 
salary are not according to experience and other professional challenge 
[LISTSEP]
Pay is a little le 
lower pay rate than competition 
le salary compared to work u done 
The pay for specialist position and up is nowhere near the market median 
You 'll wear an abundance of hat and only get paid for one of them 
poor pay poor management for worker 
Underpaid and overworked 
Salary is higher than others in the industry , but still not where it need to be to gather top talent 
low salary and tourchers everyone 
Salary could be a tad higher , but nothing unreasonable 
The pay is below average 
You will be told that you should put the need of the player first and foremost and then you will be paid le and informed you are leaving money on the table if you do not rush through the work , pushing a much of it off on your coworkers a possible 
Not too much variety in game They pay way under market value 
Lower pay than average in Bay Area 
Lower salary compared to similar company 
The pay is insanely low for what you have to deal with on a daily basis along with the skill they expect you to perform 
Considering how much money the company make , it 's a bit insulting that the customer support rep are n't being paid more 
No bonus , a lot of routine task 
low pay is the problem 
salary is a bit low but rest benefit compensate for it 
Management , HR , amenity , pay wa awful 
Solid benefit ( maybe not a competitive a those from the tech industry ) , and process can sometimes be very unidirectional ( le room / time for creative approach , more repetitive task ) 
Pay is very low compared to industry for work and the 
If you currently have a par time or temporary job somewhere else and need stable pay and benefit , you could give this job a try temporarily till you find something better but do not think you will be in this job for year 
Salary , benefits/perks are very average 
bad climate and incompetitive benefit 
Very low pay , not competitive with Bay Area standard 
Poor benefit package 
Almost no perk , especially considering what other Bay Area company offer 
Way too many hour , known for underpaying employee 
We would get free food in the cafeteria , but management kept buying food no one wanted , resulting in a lot of food no one would touch 
They may call you back just to under pay you and over work you again 
low pay than similar company 
Will pay you well below the area average for that job 
while it 's a fun place to be , the terrible benefit and really low pay make it an undesirable place to work in the long-term 
2-3 year but the upside is most people end up going to work for the `` cool tech company '' that offer the usual bay area perk 
Talent retention policy ( salary , 
Not a competitive salary , they ask a little bti more considering the salary 
Worst pay I 've seen from one of the biggest gaming company in the world 
Pay is substandard 
I wa being paid about 20 % le than I should have been 
The pay is unfair towards local and candidate from Eastern Origin 
Pay is mediocre 
You get free swag and get to go to some cool company party ( the company literally throw money around so people who do n't need to be at certain event can go ) , so you really give away a good amount of what you could be making for these luxury 
Most gamers hate ubisoft due to their cash grabbing update and buggy intital release 
pay check is n't good 
That way they do n't have to provide full time benefit 
The company doe n't pay well , but the stability of the company is a good counter to that 
Paid poorly and manager do n't trust anyone who doe n't speak French ! 
Too low salary , Management doesnt listen to employee 
Could provide a little more direction to new hire , and boost the investment in perks/salary to compete with other area tech company 
There 's a lot of political maneuvering at the studio Salary is sub-industry standard 
very low salary , turnaround is high and they do n't seem to care 
Less salary than other local company no annual bonus 
Evolving industry so need to be very adaptable to constant change , pay is OK 
You get to go to paris 
I noted that there wa n't a whole lot of leg room regarding what your pay wa and how you can stand out to get a promotion besides just becoming lead for a team 
Also Uplay doe a lot of fantastic thing for u developer , but Ubisoft make no effort to explain that to consumer 
Pay is very LOW compared to industry 
Not the largest game publisher No CTO to overview the technology decision inside the company Salaries are ok , but they are not the best 
Salary and benefit are subpar 
They can be a bit stingy with compensation 
not many perk ( free soda , trail mix ) 
Seemingly somewhat stingy with compensation 
Middle management heavy , low pay compared to equivalent company in area , very hard to increase salary beyond yearly minimal bump and weak bonus , not a progressive technology culture , very much an old boy system of promotion based on friendship 
No perk beyond a free can of soda on every floor and a yearly meeting that suck 
Pay is much le than at other company , because they figure you really want to work in video game you are willing to take a pay cut 
Chaotic at time with job priority from management Salary low compared to other company Benefits not a good a others 
Salary is not up to the mark 
the salary is way too le 
Poor pay 
No bonus for the developer that crunch for month , but there are several bonus per year for the administration that sit around and do nothing everyday 
HR is incompetent 
The salary hike is bit low 
They could improve their salary offer 
Employees getting paid in worthless NFTs now a well 
Salary for fresher is too le 
There is no growth , Salary is low 
Less salary a compare to other company 
Vastly below-average compensation 
The only con is Compensation 
Bad pay Sometime a bit lacking in vision during project 
Salary is very le Promotion process is quite slow 
salary is the only con 
Employees are data and salary is bad 
Low salary Small salary raise every 6 month 
low package , on site work 
If you are anything else in the production role , your salary wo n't be that mush 
Very le Salary
