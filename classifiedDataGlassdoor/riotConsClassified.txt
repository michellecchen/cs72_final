That ’ s cool for the diversity , but that make the team building and recruiting effort more difficult and cumbersome ( time zone difference , jet lag , etc… 
Riot doe n't really do black and white 
On the bright side , almost all the product owner speak Chinese and the goal of the office is to have full local and chinese speaking management in the next couple of year , just like any other foreign office 
I think this will improve a our office get larger and more diverse set of Rioters are brought onboard 
Product and Delivery discipline have huge variance in competency of individual 
I love playing online and console game because I consider myself a nerd 
Diversity & Inclusion is something the leadership is taking seriously , but it 's got a long way to go 
Example : I 've heard multiple people from Product Riot claim that Riot 's mission is to be `` the most diverse gaming company in the industry 
`` Diversity is awesome , but that represents a huge misalignment with the mission most of the rest of Riot is prioritizing their effort around 
Lack of Hierarchy 
Sometimes unorganized , information often `` word of mouth '' -Some team very silo 'd -Requires proactive people , little direction at time -Crunch time ( this is common in the industry , and doe n't seem worse by any mean compared to other industry job ) -Relatively diverse ( could hire more women/people of color , it 's fairly good but it could be better ) 
Diversity is not taken seriously 
There is a diversity initiative , but the truth is leadership is not empathetic of diversity and doe n't fully internalize the positive of hiring minority 
* Terrible LGBT support overall despite the recent hype given to the charity donation for the Trevor Project 
Slightly older worker may feel out of place with such a young group of employee 
I 'll leave it at that , interview a many female Rioters a you can to get a real feel of what happens 
Bosses do n't dominate the discussion and all Rioters are encouraged to participate 
There is no real equal opportunity help for minority group like woman at riot , other than Riot Dames ( but it doe n't help very much ) Extremely disorganized : 
That inclusivity can sometimes slow the process of creating new thing down tremendously , hamstring good idea by involving far too many people than are necessary up front , and giving everyone the feeling that their opinion is a equally valid a someone else 's when , in some case 
Being more inclusive of different work style could save u a lot of headache in our execution woe 
Downtown Culver City or the Palms are also great option if you STILL want to be close to `` thing to do '' , without paying high rent , but if you do n't mind a roomate or two , Santa Monica is a great place to live 
* In general a lot move very slowly because you need to generate buy-in from a TON of people instead of a few chosen decision maker * While Riot ha a much higher % of minority ( racial , female , LGBT* , etc 
Downtown Culver City or the Palms are also great option if you STILL want to be close to `` thing to do '' , without paying high rent , but if you do n't mind a roomate or two , Santa Monica is a great place to live 
if you are brownnose you will like this place 
On a seperate topic , I have experienced from a friend and co-worker that people who are not a gaming-affine can sometimes feel left out 
On the bright side , almost all the product owner speak Chinese and the goal of the office is to have full local and chinese speaking management in the next couple of year , just like any other foreign office 
Riot doe n't really do black and white 
Still learning organizational maturity , lingering issue with diversity and inclusion ( improvement is noticeable , but we 're coming from a pretty bad place ) 
Employer brand issue are hard to ignore , but Riot is also taking meaningful measure toward change and inclusivity 
I 'll leave it at that , interview a many female Rioters a you can to get a real feel of what happens 
Diversity is not taken seriously 
There is a diversity initiative , but the truth is leadership is not empathetic of diversity and doe n't fully internalize the positive of hiring minority 
This doe n't seem to be improving with time , despite all the lip service management pay toward an effort to have greater diversity in leadership 
[LISTSEP]
We are part of Central , so much time and effort is put into alignment about what is the right thing to do 
I do see some team being hungry and set themselves ambitious goal , but that is not for every team 
So called Riot value are simply not valued nor believed in the company , you can feel alone just by trying to live by them 
Typically , Hong Kong Rioters do not shy away from giving tough feedback , and it 's not just a case of 'doing what your manager tell you ' 
if you say you want to make a mobile game and if that is not the studio 's vision , you may be frustrated ) 
Feedback culture 
Something could be hard to change if it is deep in your personality/character 
Generally Hong Kong thing 
a culture of true empowerment is extremely satisfying for some , but can be very daunting for others 
There are call for volunteer to run thing like eSports program on weekend and it 's frowned upon to not step up 
Also it is an environment made for self-starter , so a lay-back person wo n't be able to go far or win any acknowledgement 
Most of the decision that need to made here in the Hong Kong and Shanghai office are in scenario that a lot of company have never experienced before : such a keeping the no title policy in the company IN CHINA 
As it is getting older and most probably because of Tencent ( owner ) , thing are changing and Riot is slowly losing it identity , if until one year ago , culture and value were driving the decision , that is slowly turning into a more business driven decision 
Like every company , it 's going through some growth pain where a lot of the culture ha been lost 
It wa nearly frowned upon for you to come in on time and walk out of the office on time 
crazy work hour were a `` social norm '' 
Constant self-development obligation 
——— Hong Kong a a place to Live 
The passion and emphasis on culture fit mean there 's little tolerance for non-gamers and questionable culture fit 
It ’ s very easy to be taken in by the culture at Riot and forget about the outside world 
Some people are better at this than others , but I have never bought into the mission of a company so much before so I personally struggle with maintaining a healthy balance 
We will help you if you ask for it , but nobody is going to babysit you 
You are the captain of your destiny at Riot : ) * Culture fit is a must We can create such a great working environment because we believe in the same core value 
Bro-culture , I believe there is still this bad legacy from a subject ( game ) that in the past we had a majority of man a main audience and public 
IMO this had changed and we need to eliminate behavior that are complacent to a Bro-culture 
I think this is regarding a fear of risk taking or complacency 
Not a lot in my experience , but it seems like it is hard for Riot Games to find senior professional that can provide the leadership and vision while fitting the gamer culture 
Riot is not perfect , and mistake and issue crop up all the time , what I like is the attitude that all Riot take in dealing with them 
Riot really is a culture of work hard , play hard 
To use an anthropological analogy , Riot is hunter friendly , not farmer friendly 
in other word friendship coming on the front of hard work bad salary for lower role ridiculous working hour : being a rioter is not a job , is a lifestyle If you want to join Riot prepare to be a RIoter and not a human being with a social life instead 
If you do n't believe and live by Riot culture value or have poor judgement , you will stick out like a nail 
No work life balance There is a have and have not culture here 
Company run like it 's a startup ; lean team responsible for huge feature 
the Riot Values are hardly applied to EU 
Startup mentality , corporation speed 
Europe is often forgotten 
`` Old Guard '' leader protected by past success and rarely held accountable without great effort , and risk 
Feedback culture can be manipulated by those who want to retain power or squash criticism 
Attitude towards new product development ha resulted in isolationist thinking , culture are literally different , so are performance metric and accountability , between large product group at the company ( esports , league , new game , central service ) 
Struggling to deal with the lack of diversity it 's culture and focus on core gamers ha created , mostly male management is blind and biased to the priority of the problem 
Success requires being a member of the `` bro culture/boys club '' or working yourself to death to be visible , you need to play the `` Cover Your A 
Accountability culture can be used against you ( your leader will usually push fault down to the first person who claim fault , rather than take accountability themselves ) 
He also stated I didn ’ t fit the Riot Games “ culture 
In high school I wa picked on for being a nerd 
These are all solvable with the right mentality though ! 
As a woman , I wa really worried about bro culture at Riot 
But there are pocket of bro culture here and there , which can make me feel isolated 
-When a single music video take a long to make a some AAA game and that 's celebrated , there 's a significant cultural problem 
Instead of feeling like we 're working together to deliver to player , I frequently feel like I have to battle bureaucracy , unnecessary process , and people who have lost track of why Riot exists and what we 're here to do 
Despite motto around staying hungry , I think we 've lost site of what that mean in an environment where it seems like we have all the time/money in the world 
ton of employee who I could not give a clear example of value delivered over the course of a day , week , month , year 
Too many Rioters are n't held accountable for poor decision-making 
The flat structure of Riot may have worked when it wa smaller , but a it 's grown it ha n't developed the necessary management and hierarchical structure to manage the growth and keep the company mission ( s ) focused 
Getting alignment across the company can be tough 
If you 're lucky to have a good manager , you 're good to go , otherwise , you 'll find that your passion for the product , the company , and the industry will quickly disappear 
Sometimes project are just abandoned or forgotten about , a middle management and team leader are rewarded for 'exciting ' stuff like new project , not maintaining old project that are n't flashy , even if they maintain an important function 
Entitlement : Entitlement ha gone up significantly at Riot and is often found in those with the least reason to feel entitled 
Cultural fit seems to be more important than skill or experience 
Crazy a they really have no idea who they are or what their culture is 
No leadership , immaturity , arrogance , and the strangest approach to culture which only leaf new employee like me in fear 
Love this cult or leave ! I hear some also complain about bullying practice by management and experienced it first-hand 
Again , bad leadership -The company care more about screening for the willingness to become a cult member than they do about hiring people that can get the job done 
`` We do n't use the 'e ' word here 
The company ha a very `` bro '' atmosphere that is not welcoming to woman 
Despite obvious effort to clean up on the diversity front , there is definitely a male-focused culture 
Lack of humility 
Overly social culture lead to group think mentality in day to day decision 
Company culture ( in practice ) 
Young culture lack selflessness and mature response to interpersonal problem 
Sexism 
Transphobia 
Feedback culture turn into bullying & it 's impossible to stop the bullying without being told you do n't meet Riot 's cultural value 
Sadly , like many successful company that failed ( Blackberry , Nokia ) , Riot leadership team build up a big ego and hasn ’ t been humble and lived up to the manifesto 
Companies who can ’ t continue inventing and being humble always fail 
I wish the company practiced what it preached 
The feedback culture seems great when it is sold to you a a candidate but once you are immersed it becomes suffocating and paralyzing 
They have lofty aspiration that in no way match the actual talent deployed , and structure by which it operates 
It feel like most people are there to hang out and look pretty 
Unfortunately , Riot doe n't meet it 's own standard 
The company value are very often misused for whatever purpose is desirable at that moment 
While these people are smart and passionate , they 're also not living up to the `` humbitious '' quality that Riot hire for 
Bro culture Talent ( HR ) / Riot doe n't protect against retaliation / harassment COO w confirmed harassment get 2 month w/o pay Very difficult to get salary increase / promotion 
Company promotes silence after harassment expose 
When asked about my time at Riot , the other company clearly see Riot a a joke -- and it 's not hard to see why after you see the lack of output , commitment to player , and planning and execution of actually delivering content is extremely poor 
This culture can be welcoming to many but also very hostile to some 
This is the company built by Gamers for Gamers 
If you ’ re not part of the Gaming community , it ’ s likely you won ’ t find your place here 
I think we ’ re trying to address this and I noticed that over the last year and a half we increased our focus on hiring Industry superstar without compromising our core value 
The post `` Bait & Switch '' , `` Bro Culture '' & `` Not the place for a professional challenge '' hit it on the head and are not exaggerating at all 
Management not open to change 
This place is extremely toxic 
`` Bro culture '' and harassment run rampant and pervades leadership 
As progressive a Riot is in it employee policy , HR remains the same a every other company out there 
Practicing what you preach is not followed at Riot 
This also relates to the privilege part I wrote out above : leadership sings about merit and disregard any real struggle people have when the odds are stacked against them 
They fail to recognize that people do n't `` rise to the challenge '' in their eye because they have made it a hostile , unsafe environment to do so , or that issue like sexism make it impossible for people to tackle problem 
`` It wa commonplace to find that feedback included gender-based slur for woman , but not for men 
An open feedback culture is encouraged but you can not give negative feedback to certain people or you will be shown the door 
Witch hunt are common 
Decisions are made through a social filter 
The maturity level of the organization is pretty low , and the campus feel more like a fraternity than a workplace , complete with hazing ritual , a really creepy pressure to have your peer be your main social circle despite having a life outside of work , and sexual harassment galore 
`` The company mantra `` default to trust '' doe not mean people will respect your expertise , it mean you 're not allowed to be offended when your insight is constantly dismissed and you are relegated to an entry-level workload despite a decade , or more , of experience 
Expect many company mantra to be weaponized in this way , especially if you are a woman 
Again with `` default to trust '' 
it mean if you are treated unfairly or poorly , it 's YOUR responsibility to accept that the offender `` probably did n't mean it '' instead of , I dunno , trusting that the person reporting bad behavior probably ha the mental capacity to figure out whether someone `` meant it '' or not ? `` Open feedback culture '' mean you can only give constructive criticism that `` feel good 
Unless , of course , that feedback is directed at something that is foundational to Riot a a company 
There 's an imaginary line you cross when you give feedback on the culture itself 
Suddenly you are no longer a culture fit 
because Riot ca n't possibly be fostering toxic behavior 
If you do n't like something Riot is doing , you do n't `` get it '' and you are the problem 
They wo n't fire you for this , oh no that would not fit the hip narrative pushed by the Brand team 
Meritocracy ? More like Mediocrity 
The real issue is cultural 
The bro culture is in full force but ha begun to insulate itself in the shadow the # metoo movement 
Collaborative Culture : Just a this is a pro , sometimes there is a feeling of lacking direction or vision that come with no clear cut leadership 
This is largely due to a culture that enables slow development , doe n't have many accountability structure for repeated failure 
Our culture is that of continuous feedback , but this often creates friction in developing and shipping product 
-lots of `` rah rah '' attitude around accomplishment while muttered in the same sentence to `` stay humble '' -manifesto is used a a shield for bad behavior , especially by manager -productivity is non-existent during the day for some team because all they do is have meeting and play LoL -one game/product , etc creates a lot of whispering and toxicity around new product a there 's a strong belief that most thing will never see the light of day -teams spin up and down at break-neck speed , creating huge communication gap and unreliability around ownership -the growing pain are frequent and totally unchecked by Senior Leadership -bro culture is everywhere and sometimes downright offensive to anyone not cis-white-male -high turnover , especially in the last 12 month 
A rapidly expanding workforce mean that we have to work hard to keep the company culture intact 
Some cultural issue regarding secrecy 
It 's not a genius idea , company have been organized this way for century for a reason 
The founder wanted their `` started in garage '' narrative so much they made a game company into a mediocre tech company 
Riot is flattered by copycat , thinking that mean Riot is setting the bar 
Not really a 'con ' , but the company ha a strong culture that they believe in stay true to a a kind of north star , and so very different personality type may feel a little marginalized here 
Interview process can be grueling and a large majority of the candidate are rejected because they would n't fit into the culture or are n't the absolute perfect fit that they 're looking for 
Lots of `` kool-aid '' in the culture 
No con , I love everything here lol 
-Having an office full of worker who are obsessed a the player is damaging because no one can be counted on to have some professional courtesy and get work done first 
-Very toxic workplace 
People behave like jerk and it is encouraged 
Because it is highly entrepreneurial , Riot can be an uncomfortable place for people who are not assertive and proactive 
The company itself is growing at a high rate , which , combined a most of the company operational knowledge and history being `` tribal '' 
This is a company that reward go-getter , so people who can create and execute their own project ( while promoting visibility of those win ) will succeed 
Riot ha n't done a great job scaling , and a lot of how it doe business come from tribal custom and value from when the company wa a lot smaller 
Some of these value get skewed and weaponized in unsavory way 
You 'll hear that the company ha a feedback culture , but that often mean the loudest voice are seen a the bravest or the most passionate 
A layer of inexperienced manager ha led to the company having a high school-like culture where the personal and professional get mixed up too often 
These criticism can get ignored or reasoned away because of the overwhelming success of the company , and instead Rioters will hear that anyone who disagrees either wa n't a `` culture fit '' or could n't `` align '' with the company or could n't hack it at Riot 
* Technically not innovative : running very old legacy architecture at some of the core element despite the marketing hype for their culture about being at the forefront of technology 
Shameful 
* Pointless cultural framework exist in an attempt to brand Riot a `` this that and the other '' 
This wa only instituted once a particular director wa hired and that wa the breaking point where the company changed from a fun place to work ( about ~500 people ) to a culturally immature struggle to be popular instead of technically successful 
) * Cultural hiring process fails to hire expert , instead hiring based on popularity 
Cultural fit tends to promote a lifestyle that result in a lot of obese and overweight employee 
It 's sad to watch people change this way and have the company not promote healthy lifestyle 
Highly homophobic and misogynistic work environment ( I 'm not LGBT or female but wow 
Riot value action and judgement over process 
Make a fuss , stand up , and fight for what 's important to you 
Too quick and aggressive in reacting to social/cultural misstep 
Not acceptable 
Our new hero are people who write up a set of fluffy meaningless value 
Seriously Riot ? We deserve better than cheesy line like `` dream big '' and `` thrive together 
`` The training that have been rolled out in order to get at our cultural issue have been massive waste of time which have led to zero change in the day to day experience of working at the studio 
Tribal knowledge and immature process and system make it hard to onboard , slow to modernize , and individual that are single source of knowledge 
The company wo n't spend resource on bad idea but competing good one will rely heavily on the personality of their owner to succeed 
Drink the kool-aid , it delicious , and in all honesty is n't a trick 
If you do n't 100 % see yourself in alignment with Riot 's vision and goal ( which they make very apparent to you during the interview and on-boarding process ) you might a well just walk away because you wo n't fit in or get anything accomplished 
First , we 're in our adolescence ; a a company , we 're still trying to figure out who we want to be 
We 're a young company with ambitious goal and a ton of opinion about how to get there 
* Some international leadership just flat-out doe n't believe in the culture 
Strong culture mean that if you 're not a gamer or have high player empathy , you will likely have some issue fitting in with colleague 
Not sure it 's because they 've been here for a while , but not the type of attitude you want to see at a high functioning organization 
Our value often ring false One example : we use that word humbitious ( ambitious but humble ) 
There 's a lack of urgency in the decision making progress , because it feel like we automatically rake in a fortune no matter what we do , so why rock the boat ? The humble part is fading too 
It 's possibly the last time you will feel like Riot really care about your growth 
This a growing powder keg that few are talking about except in frustrated whisper , because leadership ha made it clear that we should just do our work out of a passion for our player 
It seems the manager below them have interpreted that literally to mean no one should talk about money 
Riot overall ha a culture where they will bring in very high end talent then disregard everything they bring to help increase productivity and move title to Ship 
Sadly riot is far more concerned with how you say thing rather then work or action 
I 've had on multiple occasion been told by junior artist that changing the workflow wa too hard and they where fine with working slowly 
Its not a playground 
[ - ] Weakened culture screening – a a result of the company ’ s growth , there ’ s been some controversial weakening of hiring standard 
Not family oriented company 
The added struggle for someone in publishing is that it 's not just a `` when it 's done '' attitude ( which is a good attitude to have ) , it 's that a soon a it 's done , producer want to ship immediately 
There 's rarely a desire for production to ever wait once it 's `` ready '' , and because of that , player miss out 
Missed opportunity come from SOME ( not the majority ) producer , mostly at the associate level , that either do n't know the expertise of the publishing group , or do n't see the value in marketing or community 
Corporate feel 's crept in with explosive growth 
Less and le actual work get done , and this is considered acceptable loss for the sake of maintaining culture and a friendly atmosphere 
We like to consider ourselves unique 
It 's true , Riot Games is very frat like 
If you 're not in the `` boy club '' you 're not going to make it 
You have to be a bro , do all the bro thing , and make Riot Games your life 
Rapid growth ha unavoidably diluted the culture to some extent 
Riot ha ton of potential but a of now there 's a huge layer of people and management system in place that prevent any attempt at improving the day to day for the team and making the culture more in line with how it portrays itself 
Mark & Brandon 's vision on management and culture is what got me to join the studio and it wa sad that the walk wa so far from the talk 
Different view point are not welcome 
If you 're an introvert you might want to pas too a Riot culture promotes assertiveness and score low on respect of different view point , thoughtfulness and collaboration 
Teams also do n't like to depend on each other and rather than fix their communication , they think the solution is to be totally independent from one another which emphasizes friction 
I would also not recommend if you 're a female unless you 're happy to take a passive role , take note and say yes all the time 
You 're there to be of service , not to have opinion 
While the guy can disagree to the point of screaming at each other , you 'll be seen a negative and difficult if you fight for your idea 
Beware what people say 
Figuring out what the true Riot culture is usually take people a full year 
Because we value making the right decision for player instead of a single manager 's decision , stuff take longer than usual 
I 'm okay with that , because I prefer the democratic approach 
Let the witch hunt begin 
The need to maintain Riot culture in addition to finding highly qualified candidate can make it feel like you 're constantly searching for a unicorn 
It 's super important to find cultural fit 
Riot pride itself on being a flat organization 
This ha led to an impression among many that when it come to getting your vision across at Riot , only alpha personality are valued 
Riot need to learn stronger facilitation technique in order to maintain meritocratic interaction without accidentally promoting a culture that value `` waiting to talk '' over listening 
Side-effects of a strong culture of ownership 
Usually this is a great thing , a it encourages team to take responsibility for what they create end-to-end without pointing finger when they assumed another team would handle something for them 
Burn out is common , illness rip through the company , and if you begin to lose faith in the culture it 's a quick spiral out of the company 
Bad team player ( bully ) being unfairly favored and good talented respectful team player being disrespected , unappreciated and left out 
A system that breed `` Bully '' mentality 
To survive is to become a bully or leave 
Managers that are not team player Overdone , immature , clique-like , cult-like culture that kill good talented worker : 
The overbearing culture cause the worker to not be free to be themselves or even human , forcing unrealistic conformity , stifle personal identity , and brainwashes the worker ( you are just a number who is undeserving ) 
Individuality is discouraged , and human need like appreciation , encouragement , and being listened to , is close to non-existent No real opportunity : 
Over a long period of time , the female worker is prone to feel like she ha to be like a male to fit in and achieve 
Do n't expect to work here for the money 
The feedback culture is sometimes ignored when it doe n't line up with idea that upper management have already decided on 
Riot 's culture is more conducive to being overly vocal 
The revered culture at Riot is perceived much differently than lived 
Riot ha a cultish vibe to it that extends from offspring to significant others 
The superiority indoctrination begin in the orientation process called `` de-newbification '' , which is meant to be tongue-in-cheek about becoming a better League player , but ha gross undertone of how the way you 've been making game prior to Riot ha been flawed 
This inability to recognize their own shortcoming and projecting instead an elitist culture internally is what disappointed me the most about working at Riot 
Meanwhile the person next to you could be day trading on their computer all day , be habitually late to meeting , and be promoted because they assimilate to their Director 's personality and culture 
`` Player 's experience first / Challenge convention / Focus on talent and team / Take play seriously / Stay hungry ; stay humble 
`` On paper , the Riot manifesto look amazing 
Nobody feel accountable for anything meaning that nobody really care about delivering on time , or simply delivering anything at all 
Doing anything is always about finding a consensus or getting alignment , never about challenging convention 
Challenging convention is actually risky at Riot because you can easily be labelled a “ complicated to work with ” , “ pig headed ” or “ culturally not aligned ” 
All these behaviour are due to a lack of distinct direction , ownership and accountability at every level 
Management seems down on relational database technology in general , attitude is to move everything to NoSQL technology 
Beyond that there is a premadonna wall amongst many of the engineer that impedes progressive creative engineering solution 
( - ) Narcissism/Lack of Hubris 
Patrick 's Day event of 2012 , but I agree wholeheartedly with him about it 
Unacceptable for a game that want to be the banner game of E-Sports 
* Meeting culture can be kinda lax , which is annoying if you are not lax yourself 
* Inter-group ( particularly between team and initiative ) trust seems low at time , which is weird , given that trust is one of the cornerstone of Riot 's value 
Processes are non-existent or broken in the name of non-conformity 
Riot culture is EXTREMELY biased towards extrovert , often to our detriment when we rally behind big personality over thoughtful quiet type 
Here are excerpt from existing review that resonate with my experience : “ Riot ha n't done a great job scaling , and a lot of how it doe business come from tribal custom and value from when the company wa a lot smaller 
Some of these value get skewed and weaponized in unsavory way 
” “ Employees who don ’ t agree , or truthfully criticize work are flipping a coin on their job ” “ Criticisms can get ignored or reasoned away because of the overwhelming success of the company , and instead Rioters will hear that anyone who disagrees either wa n't a `` culture fit '' or could n't `` align '' with the company or could n't hack it at Riot 
Still , content output dwindled a the 'horizontal ' culture rested at odds with the unchecked growth 
Hilariously masturbatory company-or-team-wide e-mail and speech about humility 
Now that we 're getting bigger , we have gotten more effective at on-boarding new Rioters in their respective department and also in understanding our core value 
We are hard core gamers and we lead bottom-up 
You 'll probably flounder if you do n't embrace that ideal or do n't enjoy game 
Bro culture is real : This come up a lot in other review because it ’ s true 
I don ’ t think Rioters do this to be intentionally discourteous , but it ’ s super frustrating nonetheless 
Teams get spun up and down constantly and many individual posse tribal knowledge and don ’ t pas them on to others 
Feedback : Riot ’ s a feedback oriented culture , except Rioters are terrible at giving feedback 
Instead of just saying , “ give feedback to this person ” , we need to coach Rioters on the way to best give and receive it 
Long term this is especially worrisome because the larger Riot is , the more likely the subculture go undetected 
Finally , the culture of feedback is completely broken 
Extreme harassment and discriminatory language are the norm in some team 
The attitude is def not `` Spend like it 's my own money '' despite leadership trying to hammer that concept in 
It 's time to clean up our spending and act like a mature company 
Spend money where it 's needed and be unafraid of that , but tighten up on waste ! 
Lastly , the culture around being gamers and curious problem solver is a huge boon to the company , but the other side of the office culture can quite the opposite 
The idea of a bro culture is slowly establishing itself in Riot and ha the unfortunate side effect of alienating stellar individual 
First , we 're in our adolescence ; a a company , we 're still trying to figure out who we want to be 
We 're a young company with ambitious goal and a ton of opinion about how to get there 
More broadly , Riot 's culture is a self-directed one 
Flat corporate culture concept doe not work 
Everyone work around the clock , and put in extra hour 
If you have sensitivity to bro-ish behavior , crude joke about gender , ethnicity , age and trolly harassment you should avoid Riot 
These are part of the culture in most of the team except data science and art 
This is not a problem if you are fiercely competitive and assume this going in , however if you are not a fan of this kind of environment it can be very disheartening , especially in a culture priding itself on transparency and feedback sharing a well a friendliness 
Make a fuss , stand up , and fight for what 's important to you 
Riot value action and judgement over process 
Rapid growth ha unavoidably diluted the culture to some extent 
Working ridiculous hour is something that you impose on yourself though , no one make you do it 
You do n't need more employee , you need better leader that lead by example 
Subversive bullying is reinforced 
While embracing this entrepreneurial culture wa energizing for myself , I can empathize with personality who do not like having to find their own opportunity 
Riot doe recognize this and provides candidate and new Rioters an opportunity to get a taste of the culture and see if it is a fit for them 
Our value often ring false One example : we use that word humbitious ( ambitious but humble ) 
There 's a lack of urgency in the decision making progress , because it feel like we automatically rake in a fortune no matter what we do , so why rock the boat ? The humble part is fading too 
It 's possibly the last time you will feel like Riot really care about your growth 
This a growing powder keg that few are talking about except in frustrated whisper , because leadership ha made it clear that we should just do our work out of a passion for our player 
It seems the manager below them have interpreted that literally to mean no one should talk about money 
Riot 's culture is more conducive to being overly vocal 
The added struggle for someone in publishing is that it 's not just a `` when it 's done '' attitude ( which is a good attitude to have ) , it 's that a soon a it 's done , producer want to ship immediately

Missed opportunity come from SOME ( not the majority ) producer , mostly at the associate level , that either do n't know the expertise of the publishing group , or do n't see the value in marketing or community 
Because it is highly entrepreneurial , Riot can be an uncomfortable place for people who are not assertive and proactive 
The truth is that your experience at Riot will depend heavily on your manager , your team , and your discipline 
Explosive growth over the last few year ha led to some growing pain related to communication , culture , and facility 
Mandated crunch is rare , but there is definitely a culture of voluntary long hour 
If Riot can add some key , good culture fit exec , I see the outlook getting better 
Stated culture did n't always align with my experience 
If one were to isolate a turning point in Riot ’ s culture , my money ’ s on the Tencent buy-out in late 2015 
Company culture , which used to be flawed ( a any place is ) but usually good at heart ha become much more “ Lord of the Flies ” a senior leader are preoccupied with empire building or just completely checked out 
Core gamer dogma mean this place is non-inclusive a all getout 
[ + ] Culture dilution : As a consequence of extreme growth ( from forty or so employee in early 2008 to comfortably over a thousand in mid 2013 ) , it is hard to know if we are maintaining our core cultural tenet with every hire 
The bad news is that sheer size make it hard to identify people who do n't actually fit our culture , and make it hard to transfer the desired culture from existing `` good '' employee to new employee before another batch arrives 
Riot is still one of the most open and agile company I 've worked for , and it continues to do thing to break down these barrier with smaller town-hall meeting with Marc & Brandon 
[ + ] Cult of heroic : Riot value the ability of a single hero ( or small team of hero ) to rise up to the challenge and excel the way out of a crisis 
But just because we 're good at fighting fire doe not mean we should start them or ignore them when they 're small 
As we mature , we need to create an environment where we have hero but no heroic 
The important thing to note here is that Riot ha a deep dedication to continuous improvement 
I have every confidence that we will be able to address these `` Cons '' a long a we stay true to our core tenet 
Not family oriented company 
When I wa first hired , I received a lengthy song and dance about how Riot wa different than other game company 
They claimed they respected work-life balance and that , while crunch time did happen , normal employment hour averaged 40-50 hour a week 
Riot encourages `` go-getter '' and `` leader , '' which often translates to people who put their own ambition in front of the greater good 
Riot try to bill itself a `` anti-corporate , '' but it overall culture is corporate in the extreme 
The company seems to feel that a hit game give them license to treat others with contempt or dismissal , which cut them off from a lot of potentially beneficial people and idea 
A general fraternity atmosphere occasionally turn into the actively cruel 
Patrick 's Day 2012 , featuring little people dressed up a leprechaun 
[ - ] Weakened culture screening – a a result of the company ’ s growth , there ’ s been some controversial weakening of hiring standard 
Growing issue with humility 
If you 're not part of a click , people talk rumor about you and look down on you 
Decisions are made through a social filter 
This is impacting morale and employee retention 
Behind the glitzy art work , steampunk coffee shop and open workspace lie one of the worst toxic and sexist environment you 'll ever work in 
All the recent sexist article are all true 
There are too many immature `` bros '' there , contributing to the terrible bro culture 
The company wo n't spend resource on bad idea but competing good one will rely heavily on the personality of their owner to succeed 
Drink the kool-aid , it delicious , and in all honesty is n't a trick 
If you do n't 100 % see yourself in alignment with Riot 's vision and goal ( which they make very apparent to you during the interview and on-boarding process ) you might a well just walk away because you wo n't fit in or get anything accomplished 
Though there 's a core-value of openness , this is n't always carried forward 
A bias toward action and self-starter 
Some cultural issue regarding secrecy 
Now that we 're getting bigger , we have gotten more effective at on-boarding new Rioters in their respective department and also in understanding our core value 
We are hard core gamers and we lead bottom-up 
You 'll probably flounder if you do n't embrace that ideal or do n't enjoy game 
Company culture , Management ( Lack of any manager accountability ) 
Work culture may vary greatly among team , some people seem to be happy about their incompetency 
Real day-to-day culture is many time too far from the aspiration 
Parts of the company culture can be quite toxic 
They still have the mentality of 50y ago where the bos ha to overlook the worker to make sure they are working 
Riot slogan `` we are not a family , we are sport team '' and `` slow to hire , fast to fire '' sometimes are unexpected , so now we try to manage expectation in advance 
Lastly everyone should be aware that the hiring process tends to be very long due to the strong focus on cultural alignment and hence an incredibly high amount of interview 
Typically , Hong Kong Rioters do not shy away from giving tough feedback , and it 's not just a case of 'doing what your manager tell you ' 
Europe is often forgotten 
-While LAX office culture and atmosphere are excellent , regional office across the globe could differ from that depending on the local leadership , it value , background , etc 
Riot is not perfect , and mistake and issue crop up all the time , what I like is the attitude that all Riot take in dealing with them 
Riot really is a culture of work hard , play hard 
To use an anthropological analogy , Riot is hunter friendly , not farmer friendly 
There 's a general 'we 're awesome ' mentality , but it 's pretty superficial 
Company ha an awesome culture but is also growing fast 
How to keep that culture strong while integrating new people ( especially all of the Hollywood people ) will be a challenge 
Also , company culture want to ignore this stuff 
This is coupled with a non-communicative engineering team for both tool and engine , and an incredibly condescending set of people who will talk down to anybody who is not an engineer and treat them a big old 'dumb dumbs ' 
It 's le about doing the wise/right thing but saying the right thing 
Zero tolerance for remote work ( CEO enforced ) 
Pushy moral agenda & covid restriction 
-Feedback culture is excessive in some team , leading to the most diluted and vanilla execution for many product -Minimum quality bar in some discipline significantly below industry standard -Innovation is often met with a lot of resistance -Borderline cult-like culture and self celebration , if you do n't love the IP it can be exhausting -Being social is basically a requirement , which can be exhausting for those who would rather just focus on the work -Majority of time daily is spent in meeting or side task ( writing documentation , random self improvement work etc ) -I would like to reiterate meeting 
The result is a competitive and cliquish culture that punishes anything different and never place accountability where it belongs 
Riot doe n't know the value of a dollar 
Constant re-orgs and rotating door of leadership make culture difficult to maintain 
I did n't like the bro culture 
Culture ha history of mysogony but is getting better 
It feel like you joined a college fraternity at time 
So , with the culture changing , reward for performance “ standardized ” , and unaccountable leadership who continue to be allowed to get away with anything , the best talent is now leaving ( during a pandemic ) 
They will most likely protect themselves and tell their own narrative regarding those who have left were not a cultural fit or were negative , i 
There are many amazing and talented people there ( LoL , TFT & Valorant would be the highlight , though they ’ ve also lost a plethora of talent ) but it is a cult and be wary of the narrative 
Have to be on time 
Becoming overrun by people looking for Riot and Riot Leadership to represent each and every single one of their moral belief , and if they do n't 
Open feedback culture is slowly being pushed aside in favor of le transparent feedback via manager 
Used to be considered not good enough if you did n't play the right kind of hardcore game , but supposedly that ha since changed 
Questionable middle management , heavy meeting culture 
Despite motto around staying hungry , I think we 've lost site of what that mean in an environment where it seems like we have all the time/money in the world 
They are entrenched 
Some of them create or have created highly toxic workplace 
`` good ol boy club '' mentality is still in full swing at Riot , even if they 're not sexually harassing people anymore 
They operate in total secrecy 
Culturally , you will be expected to “ be positive ” 
Or if they know , they do n't care to change 
This often creates a secret toxic environment you should be very aware of 
A lot of leader within Riot want `` Yes '' people , not people who challenge their thinking or raise issue 
If you want an example of this , Riot 's sexual harassment culture did n't change until a string of Kotaku article embarrassed leadership publicly enough for them to change thing 
Let the witch hunt begin 
Casual sexism , racism and transphobia is pretty rampant here 
This place is extremely toxic 
`` Bro culture '' and harassment run rampant and pervades leadership 
As progressive a Riot is in it employee policy , HR remains the same a every other company out there 
Practicing what you preach is not followed at Riot 
This also relates to the privilege part I wrote out above : leadership sings about merit and disregard any real struggle people have when the odds are stacked against them 
They fail to recognize that people do n't `` rise to the challenge '' in their eye because they have made it a hostile , unsafe environment to do so , or that issue like sexism make it impossible for people to tackle problem 
`` It wa commonplace to find that feedback included gender-based slur for woman , but not for men 
An open feedback culture is encouraged but you can not give negative feedback to certain people or you will be shown the door 
Witch hunt are common 
It 's not a genius idea , company have been organized this way for century for a reason 
The founder wanted their `` started in garage '' narrative so much they made a game company into a mediocre tech company 
Riot is flattered by copycat , thinking that mean Riot is setting the bar 
Being a woman doe NOT make me weak and his insinuation that I needed to be hugged is outrageous 
I loved Riot with all my heart when I started 
Bro culture Talent ( HR ) / Riot doe n't protect against retaliation / harassment COO w confirmed harassment get 2 month w/o pay Very difficult to get salary increase / promotion 
Company promotes silence after harassment expose 
Not acceptable 
Our new hero are people who write up a set of fluffy meaningless value 
Seriously Riot ? We deserve better than cheesy line like `` dream big '' and `` thrive together 
`` The training that have been rolled out in order to get at our cultural issue have been massive waste of time which have led to zero change in the day to day experience of working at the studio 
Sadly , like many successful company that failed ( Blackberry , Nokia ) , Riot leadership team build up a big ego and hasn ’ t been humble and lived up to the manifesto 
Companies who can ’ t continue inventing and being humble always fail 
Behind the glitzy art work , steampunk coffee shop and open workspace lie one of the worst toxic and sexist environment you 'll ever work in 
All the recent sexist article are all true 
There are too many immature `` bros '' there , contributing to the terrible bro culture 
Widespread and institutionalized sexism 
Poor treatment of mother and expectant mother , a well a woman in general 
In addition to that , all you have to do is look at the ratio of woman in leadership position to realize that there is institutionalized bias against promoting woman 
Recent negative publicity ha highlighted [ cultural ] growing pain that the company ha historically been slow to lean into a it 's transitioned into a much larger/multi-game studio 
They essentially need to tame the `` Wild West '' of their early startup day , and put stronger rule and process in place that protect the small number of individual who might be unintentional `` victim '' of that small town culture , and that punish the small number of individual that exploit it 
Unfortunately , there are pocket of resistance ( leader and old guard who do n't want to let go of their `` kingdom '' ) , and pocket of activist ( who are using this a an excuse to start a witch hunt/power-grab and transform the culture of the company entirely from one that is united by a love of game into one that is divided by resentful identity politics ) 
It go beyond the sexism expressed recently in press and various blog 
They are well entrenched and have effective mechanism to quell dissent and prevent shift in culture that would compromise their power and influence 
Do n't expect to work here for the money 
The feedback culture is sometimes ignored when it doe n't line up with idea that upper management have already decided on 
Mentorship culture still lacking a a result 
I believe the value they instill in the on-ramp program for full-timers is extremely valuable and can better set contractor on the right foot to contribute even more to the company 
They have lofty aspiration that in no way match the actual talent deployed , and structure by which it operates 
It feel like most people are there to hang out and look pretty 
Riot overall ha a culture where they will bring in very high end talent then disregard everything they bring to help increase productivity and move title to Ship 
Sadly riot is far more concerned with how you say thing rather then work or action 
I 've had on multiple occasion been told by junior artist that changing the workflow wa too hard and they where fine with working slowly 
Its not a playground 
Riot grew really fast and there 's work needed to mature company system and process 
Riot resists doing simple thing that are standard across a lot of industry , because we think we 're so unique , those thing wo n't apply 
Hard to advance , lot of politics to deal with , Their “ value ” change from team to team 
Stated culture did n't always align with my experience 
fear of being a one hit wonder 
New commitment , long term plan and focus is being applied this year , which mean you are n't going to be doing exactly what you did last year 
Processes are non-existent or broken in the name of non-conformity 
Riot ha grown a lot in the past five year , and so there is some ambiguity around organization-wide priority and expectation 
Large scale is stressing Traditional Riot Values : Riot is now a large-ish company , and it bottom-up , gamer-first culture is under stress 
Many Rioters want to do something new , but the culture and the structure of the company do n't make it clear how to make that happen 
No Clear Leadership : Highly collaborative culture is great , but it far too time consuming to create horizontal alignment for every decision , including massive strategic pivot 
The company culture is a complete failure 
Challenging convention is not a good idea at Riot , a well a giving negative feedback 
Despite what the so-called `` Riot Manifesto '' say , title count at Riot , and a lot of senior people leverage them ( combined with Alpha behavior , political game and back stabbing ) to win argument and keep their status 
`` Hungry & Humble '' , I 've seen many high-level people making fun of other company and talking about Riot superiority , despite Riot constantly failing at delivering a second game in the last decade 
These people 's accountability doe n't exist , which is very disrespectful for the other employee 
In 4 year I 've experienced and seen a lot of discrimination towards sex , race and nationality , by a lot of people who never faced consequence for their action 
Extreme corporate atmosphere , with a lot of bad politics happening 
Being at Riot feel like being in a cult 
Orientation ( `` De-Newbiefication '' in the Riot language ) is basically a full week of indoctrination 
You 're forced to wear an embarassing hat and , during one of the class , you 're asked to share a painful experience , in which you felt vulnerable ( exactly like a lot of cult do ) 
A lot of company gathering in which a lot of hyperbolic ( unrealistic , in reality ) , thing about the company are said , to an audience wearing Riot clothes 
) is perceived extremely negatively 
Weaponizing the mission and manifesto in defense of being questioned about their work and decision instead of justifying the why 
Compromising strong cultural value for specific skill in new hire , bringing with them toxic bad habit from previous company 
If one were to isolate a turning point in Riot ’ s culture , my money ’ s on the Tencent buy-out in late 2015 
Company culture , which used to be flawed ( a any place is ) but usually good at heart ha become much more “ Lord of the Flies ” a senior leader are preoccupied with empire building or just completely checked out 
Core gamer dogma mean this place is non-inclusive a all getout 
This is impacting morale and employee retention 
[LISTSEP]
Lack of management for people who work during weekend 
Lack of work-life balance 
Work/Life balance is a joke 
We are not really free to do anything ( i 
If you are considering applying to u , have a very honest conversation with yourself a to whether this is something you want * Being in a company of hardcore gamers , I always get beaten when playing ! * Buckets of passion it great , but I can imagine it burning people out if they do n't make time for friend , family and health 
I think the biggest piece of advice I can say about Riot OCE is that you are n't signing up for a 9-to-5 
There is always more work to be done than people doing it ( not sure it is a con ) 
Given flexible working hour and vocation day , most of the rioter here work ( and play game ) really hard so the experience are in general very intense 
You control your role and your path but it is not a 9-5 where you just do your job , you have to want more than that and you have to be flexible and comfortable with change 
This just kill you in the long run , especially when you are asked to do more and more and more 
you will always be asked to do more and more and more and you ca n't say no because you will be laid off -no communication between department 
Passion sometimes can also be a con , and here I noticed that it wa hurting the work/life balance aspect 
Lots of inexperienced people in management role Poor work-life balance , you can work for month without rest There are still some issue with sexism in the workplace Poor performance management 
Absence of non-company friend after time ha passed 
almost impossible to find a time of a person you need You do n't know what 's going on in the company ( new game , etc ) due to security reason Not clear growth system There is always `` we '' in success and `` you '' in failure 
Some people ca n't ( do n't ) self manage their involvement properly , over commit , and burn out 
Working with people who are burnt out and become caustic is never enjoyable 
People here are passionate about what they do , but this mean it is not a place for people who just want to go to a 9-5 job in a fun environment 
Late hour and working on weekend is not uncommon 
• It can be very hard to get something done 
Regardless of how good an idea is , how easy it might be to pull off , we ’ re always under staffed which result in having to fight to get a project off the ground , let alone released 
• Work-life balance is very difficult , especially for new people 
Some people get burnt out , some people let their personal life fall apart ; others are self-aware enough to manage their balance well 
Work/life balance for sure 
When I wake up I check my email , just before I go to sleep I check my email 
Do n't expect someone guiding you day to day and telling you what to do 
Simply because we are understaff and hiring is pain : p Less rest time/sleep since I joined here 
Working in gaming industry requires you to be good/keep learning in your domain expertise and also spend time to play game , which could be quite demanding 
Although is something hard to control given the job responsibility , you can not have flexible working hour nor home office 
The work life balance is not too good , a the work load can sometimes become overwhelming and situation can become very stressful 
I love it and thrive in an environment that move at a fast pace , but I know there are a lot of people out there that prefer a more consistently stable and routine work environment 
Rents are so expensive that a a sole provider in your family , thing can be tight even on an above average salary , especially if you want to live in a family-friendly area around Dublin without a hellish commute to the office 
This limit their opportunity to interact with player , our partner and the growing number of new Rioters 
If you like socializing with co-worker after work , there are limited way due to our startup office size 
We have so much we want to do , but getting the right people to help is hard : ( 
I have n't been with the company very long , and I 'm still very much in the honeymoon phase which doe n't show any sign of wearing off 
However , it doe n't do a good job of managing the fall out 
Workload and stress are in no way reflected in payscale or recognition at company event 
Hours end up being pretty long , but a lot of that is just because it 's so easy to stay at the office to play a game , or get a cup of coffee , or stay after for the gym or yoga , etc 
None so far ! Management are very busy a lot of the time though so it can be hard to get time with them 
Struggling to do too much , with an inability to focus mean strategic decision flip-flop and rarely last longer to 3-4 month 
I finally stepped up and told our manager my concern which he then used a an opportunity to talk about my personality and how it wa frustrating that I mentioned my family at work sometimes and that I made funny comment sometimes 
Can be easy to be overwhelmed at first a no one is going to hand hold you , work life balance can be off if you do n't keep an eye on it , growth is on you to figure out which is a good and bad thing , easy to feel intimidated by longer standing worker and strong personality 
Work/Life balance requires refocusing on smaller team 
Too many cook , not enough accountability 
-Riot is suffering from corporate bloat : Most area of Riot grew too big , and the result is a diluted talented pool a well a a lot of wasted time and money by people who ca n't help but create work and distraction for others , detracting from the company 's mission to be player focused 
You will be surprised how many people do n't have much work to do and just play hour of video game each day 
They receive a lot of feedback which make it very tough or them mentally to persevere ( so burnout is a thing ) 
Everyone is so focused on work , they barely have time to seek each other out , get help and provide support for each other , work a one team 
We struggle at time with work life balance -A bit slow-moving and some fear of failure 
Play game 2-3 hour a day ? Not a problem on some team 
Growing pain and inability to keep talent at this point a they do not know how to allow employee to be themselves and there is no understanding of work-life balance 
You are human labor 
I recently had a coworker leave because she did n't feel like she could be a working mother at Riot , and I completely agree 
Work-life balance 
Difficult to have a life outside of work 
Difficult work/life balance for some people 
Some people may find it difficult to maintain their drive in the face of continuous development 
Discussions about doing without ever having time to do 
The game during work sound great but make focus very difficult 
The level of productivity one experience on a given day is alarmingly low , and the ratio of useful people to useless people is similar 
If you do n't want your life to be work , then work-life balance 
The work is n't focus 
Feedback is a two edge sword here 
I 'm all for a chill work space , but there 's a difference between understanding that jean and cuss word do n't affect quality of work , and allowing people to get away with playing 35 hour of video game a week at their desk and somehow still claiming to `` add value 
And they 're burnt out from carrying the slack of the dud who do n't actually do anything special but SWEAR they are visionary 
Most people are frustrated with the workload , management , slow development cycle , or all of the above at Riot 
( Work/Life balance difficulty ) On some team it 's normal to come in early , stay late , work weekend , holiday , and be part of an on-call rotation 
They 'll say that you 're only obligated to work 40 hour per week , but those 40 could be overlapping with your personal life and you 're expected to be willing to sacrifice it to make meeting and keep work moving forward 
In reality it 's not uncommon to work 50-60+ hour week 
This lead to many team being undermanned and overworked 
Most Rioters work very hard , but there are obvious case where lazy or not-useful Rioters are coasting 
Too many first time manager with no clue how to manage others -Touts open feedback culture , but management doe not take feedback well -Does not care about employee -Hiring process is too slow and potential new employee are not treated with respect -Frat-like atmosphere in certain department -Terrible work/life balance -Not a lot of transparency 
Much of the debt wa created during the `` just get something out the door so we can survive a a company '' day 
This is not a shop to clock in and out 
It 's hard work 
Expectations are high , both internally and externally , and people looking for a 40-hour work week should likely stay away 
* WAY TOO MANY EMPLOYEES PLAYING LoL DURING WORKING HOURS 
* Majority of technical side of the company suffers from unhealthy lifestyle 
) * Work life balance is abysmal 
Riot is a global company and travel is expected in order to maintain healthy team coordination 
The takeaway ? As long a you perform well in your role it doe n't matter how you treated Rioters 4 year ago 
Work/Life balance is a lost cause at Riot , if you are not in a relationship then Riot is the place for you , it like being in a frat-house and you get paid for it 
There are strong social pressure at Riot that make it very clear that if you want to be successful at Riot you have to spend time with your work colleague outside of work 
The workload doe average with similar position in other industry , but you must account extra time to play game with the team and immerse in the company culture , so if you are not passionate videogames you might feel a bit excluded 
not a 9 to 5 job 
It often come down to 2-3 superstar carrying the load for the team while others are content to do the bare minimum and skate by 
Work/life balance is really tough when it feel like everyone around you is sprinting all the time 
No one is telling you to work late or on weekend , but it 's easy to fall into that 
I often feel guilty leaving at 7 or getting in after 10 for personal appointment 
A lot of that is on me but Riot really leaf work-life balance up to the individual which make the work-life balance battle feel like a `` every man for themselves '' kind of fight 
* Work-life balance can be daunting to manage a you will often have the motivation to keep on working late ( but not the need ) 
Some people seem pretty relaxed at their job / lack a sense of urgency 
Riot fire people -Tad unorganized , have to self motivate and take initiative to get thing done -Long hour are great if you love your job , not so great otherwise -Need to LOVE game to work here 
But the industry and time change a doe development 
Ya got ta keep the light on basically 
The issue with this is that all good thing come to an end and if you ca n't make a new product then having the studio in one of the most expensive area in the United States start to be a big problem 
Otherwise expect to drive 2-3 hour into work 
[ - ] Hot , flat , and crowded – the current office are increasingly le hospitable to getting work done because we ’ ve outgrown our current space and are jamming people into an office that wa never designed for this sort of seating density 
It ’ s like Lord of the Flies if you want a conference room and headphone ( free from IT of course ) are a must if you want to actually focus on your own work for a beat 
Expensive to live near office 
And since the various feature team do n't coordinate their release , you 'll have situation where a period of time will go by with no content , and then all of a sudden you have to make a stack rank of feature promotion and some thing will just not get the attention they should 
be prepared to come in late ( 11AM ) and stay late ( past 8PM ) 
Continue to play the game , which is fantastic , but do n't make it your life 
They will try to take over your calendar 
Individual Rioters are responsible for maintaining their own work/life balance 
Nobody make you stay late or work weekend , but it 's very easy to fall into doing that at Riot if you do n't make a conscious effort to stay on top of it 
It is very common to be working 10+ hour every day 
If you 're used to the slow pace of that , then it 's fine , but I wa n't a fan 
Managers that are not flexible , do not listen to the worker , and have big ego 
no cubicle or wall between desk 
The open floor plan cause even more stress , disorganization , and lack of productivity 
Overbearing culture , feedback system , bullying , unrealistic expectation and disorganization cause excruciating level of stress , that overflow to the weekend and after work 
Work/life balance can be hard to maintain , especially during crunch period 
Work life blend lean towards the work side but not a much a other review indicate 
Along with that note , I do find that Rioters are often terrible with time management 
You will commonly see folk work 10+ hour a day , that 's primarily due to their inability to utilize their time effectively 
Company 's now large enough it 's not possible to know everyone personally 
Harder to find an affordable house in Santa Monica ( thus commuting every day ) 
Many employee play 5-6 hour a day 
You don ’ t really need to work hard to be successful ( you actually don ’ t need to be successful at all , just average and quiet ) 
You don ’ t want to screw up your cash cow 
High achiever get bored and leave 
But , a I got bogged down in work and the hour got longer , I wa getting home at 8:30 PM on AVERAGE , which even for a young person like myself , wa too much 
You pretty much want to live in the general area of Santa Monica where Riot is if you want to have a more reasonable work/life balance 
) You live close to the LAX office , which is extremely costly in term of housing and some of the cheaper area in the vicinity of Santa Monica might not be place where you 'd like to live , especially with a family 
( - ) Work/Life Balance 
This started out okay , but a my department got busier and busier and made additional hire for an increasing number of project , it slowly got a little out of control 
As I said before , Riot ha a lot of great/talented people and I enjoyed working with them , but I enjoy a life outside of work a well 
They had a number of group and company field trip which were fun , but I do n't want to live at my work 
It got to the point where a lot of my friend outside of work were concerned about the amount of time I wa spending at work and it did n't slow down the entire time I wa there 
Sure , I got OT and plenty of it , but sometimes you need a rest , and having to work twelve day in a row is a bit much 
By the end of it , I wa just burnt out and I did n't want to see the office at all 
not from lack of hard work or proper prioritization , but because the core technology we work with wa not built to sustain the level or kind of use it actually ha 
* You own your own work-life balance 
That sound like a pro , but for lot of Rioters , that just enables them to have terrible work-life balance and not correct it 
Teams and management need to do a better job of setting the expectation of reasonable balance 
This made maintaining a healthy work-life balance a challenge for me 
Work / Life Balance : As the company ha had explosive growth , sometimes people feel a though it is difficult to maintain work / life balance 
I worked at startup where the norm wa > 90 hour / week 
At Riot , I manage to still be a top performer and I honestly only work 50 hour on average per week 
I would say about 2 day / month , I am at the office late because of a deploy or because there may be that occasional live issue 
consider reading `` On Managing Yourself '' from the Harvard Business Review 
Core hour are an entire day ( 10-6 ) , whereas other company may have shorter core hour allowing a little more flexibility in every day work hour 
Work load can be quite high , and work/life balance is hard to manage 
The one downside I see is that it 's very easy to take on too much work 
This can leave you overworked for a while until you think to get others to help you out 
Our open floorplan + bad noise management in the building make concentration at your desk nearly impossible 
I rely on working from home more often in order to get work done 
I would normally opt to find a phone booth room to sequester myself in , but with the shortage of conference room space at our current HQ , it ’ s just easier to stay at home 
I honestly do n't know how any work get done with so many coffee chat during the day 
It 's hard not to spend the entire day there 
The last issue is work/life balance 
Although the company ha established an open PTO policy , frequently many Rioters will spend most of their waking time at work 
This creates a sense of missing out for those unable to spend a may hour in the office , and is ultimately unhealthy 
Work/life balance is really tough when it feel like everyone around you is sprinting all the time 
No one is telling you to work late or on weekend , but it 's easy to fall into that 
I often feel guilty leaving at 7 or getting in after 10 for personal appointment 
A lot of that is on me but Riot really leaf work-life balance up to the individual which make the work-life balance battle feel like a `` every man for themselves '' kind of fight 
You 'll be expected to find way to be productive and make awesome happen without always being told how 
overtime happens 
I have never completed all of the task that I want to finish in a day , and never felt content heading home after work 
But with all the task that need to be done , our team still run very lean 
My day is filled 150 % with task that need to get done , that I do n't get the chance to push the limit 
I constantly feel like I have to choose between doing my job , and acting on an amazing idea I have to boost our team 
I 'd like Riot to be better staffed so I can do what I wa hired to do , and improve the team , rather than only taking care of emergent task at hand 
All this lead to spotty morale for people who are passed the aforementioned `` honeymoon '' stage 
Tend to be work/life/balance issue , due to gaming at work and passion of Rioters 
Plus the stress of live service 
We all seek to do a much a we can to make amazing experience for our player but we sometimes do n't balance our our commitment well which result in high pressure to hit date and quality level 
No one here want to let player down so it put pressure on all of u to effectively manage our time and vocalize when expectation are unsustainable and will reduce the value to player 
My only negative is the whole work-life balance issue 
So make sure you 're working efficiently in the hour you do clock-in ; having effective time-management skill will benefit you in the long run 
Work-life balance is really hard to have on some team The pay is really bad , some people are being extremely underpaid in exchange for culture High turnover due to these issue 
This is why so many people are complaining about long hour and difficulty in work/life balance even though the company is bloated with too many employee 
Lay low and quiet , you might just survive 
Riot Games is the worst company if you want a job in which you can just do your 8 hour a day and disconnect 
Work-life balance is rough 
Ultimately it 's on Rioters to manage their workload and hour , so if you 're more comfortable with having a manager help you do that , you might struggle here 
It often come down to 2-3 superstar carrying the load for the team while others are content to do the bare minimum and skate by 
The difficulty lie in whether or not an individual can make an accurate evaluation in a timely fashion without being distracted by the fun , exciting , and playful nature that is working at Riot 
Things can be slow to move , often time Rioters will take on too much work resulting in slow delivery 
The office ( for now ) is spread apart enough that you are consistently late to meeting due to transit 
TONS of work which make for regular long hour 
Difficult work/life balance for some people 
Some people may find it difficult to maintain their drive in the face of continuous development 
This is not a shop to clock in and out 
Work life blend lean towards the work side but not a much a other review indicate 
Along with that note , I do find that Rioters are often terrible with time management 
You will commonly see folk work 10+ hour a day , that 's primarily due to their inability to utilize their time effectively 
And since the various feature team do n't coordinate their release , you 'll have situation where a period of time will go by with no content , and then all of a sudden you have to make a stack rank of feature promotion and some thing will just not get the attention they should 
Core hour are an entire day ( 10-6 ) , whereas other company may have shorter core hour allowing a little more flexibility in every day work hour 
I ’ ve had high-performing colleague who have switched off of new game team of their own volition because they were bored due to lack of work 
It 's hard not to spend the entire day there 
It 's easier to take on a lot more work than an individual can handle 
We struggle at time with work life balance -A bit slow-moving and some fear of failure 
a little bit hard to make work and life balanced 
[ + ] Work/life balance : Riot is not just a job , it 's a lifestyle 
Part of the growing pain will be to mature into an environment that can tolerate differing level of commitment to work hour 
Expensive to live near office 
This wa a flat-out lie ; 80-100 hour week were expected 
* Poor work-life balance 
If you 're young , single and devoted to work , this can be a good fit 
If you 're in a relationship or like doing anything outside of the office , stay away 
There is so much passion it is hard to remember to slow down and get it done right 
Lack of work-life balance 
Could be challenging for people with family 
* need to find your work / life balance , which is encouraged but not always reality depending on what you work on 
Depending on the role of course , it is not too hectic though , most people have a balanced routine * not a lot of direction or coaching on day to day which can be hard for junior role 
[ - ] Hot , flat , and crowded – the current office are increasingly le hospitable to getting work done because we ’ ve outgrown our current space and are jamming people into an office that wa never designed for this sort of seating density 
It ’ s like Lord of the Flies if you want a conference room and headphone ( free from IT of course ) are a must if you want to actually focus on your own work for a beat 
( Pro/Con ) There is n't really a work/life balance here , in part because most Rioters seem to be workaholic by nature , in part because Riot offer a ton of social and personal/professional growth activity that go on all the time , and in part because there 's just so much work to do 
Feedback is a two edge sword here 
They work a lot of night and weekend , which is o 
to try and have you forget that you just worked 70+ hour in a week 
Work-life balance could be better 
Work life balance is on you 
If you do n't want your life to be work , then work-life balance 
It 's funny and all , but sometimes I just want to get stuff done 
Riot fire people -Tad unorganized , have to self motivate and take initiative to get thing done -Long hour are great if you love your job , not so great otherwise -Need to LOVE game to work here 
There is a lot going on , and there is a collective feeling of `` should , '' not `` must '' regarding overtime 
Work/Life balance at time can be hard due to the amazing growth of the company 
Work / Life Balance : As the company ha had explosive growth , sometimes people feel a though it is difficult to maintain work / life balance 
I worked at startup where the norm wa > 90 hour / week 
At Riot , I manage to still be a top performer and I honestly only work 50 hour on average per week 
I would say about 2 day / month , I am at the office late because of a deploy or because there may be that occasional live issue 
consider reading `` On Managing Yourself '' from the Harvard Business Review 
work life balance can be challenging 
Not the best work-life balance 
Pressure to take on project outside of your day to day role 
Work-life balance Being is Sydney I missed my daily contact with my manager 
Too much work and pressure 
life balance Work intensity 
Busy schedule , sometimes overtime needed 
It ’ s exhausting , and many employee are in a state of total burnout 
Being constantly pushed to your limit is not for everyone 
Despite the full company worked and delivered a pretty significant amount of product while remote working , not being in the office is seen a not being productive 
I personally have a hard time saying no , and because of this , it wa easy to take on more than I could chew , when I first started 
You will work with people that are driven , people that work very hard , but work-life balance is important 
I have n't been with the company very long , and I 'm still very much in the honeymoon phase which doe n't show any sign of wearing off 
Work-life balance is nearly impossible , I 'd say 
Workload could be huge sometimes and company move forward with a speed of light , so sometimes it could be difficult to keep the pace without feeling overwhelmed 
This limit their opportunity to interact with player , our partner and the growing number of new Rioters 
I love it and thrive in an environment that move at a fast pace , but I know there are a lot of people out there that prefer a more consistently stable and routine work environment 
Rents are so expensive that a a sole provider in your family , thing can be tight even on an above average salary , especially if you want to live in a family-friendly area around Dublin without a hellish commute to the office 
Hiring is really slow , many department are constantly understaffed , making people overworked or having too much on their plate 
Additionally there are a few lazy people that do the bare minimum , dragging their team and others behind 
From my point-of-view , the quality-of-life I have working at Riot v a FAANG is well worth that trade off 
Ca n't mandate , always ha to partner 
Gets repetitive and the work can be stressful 
* Work/life balance can be pretty bad if you 're not structured about it 
While the company doe a great job of not requiring you to be plugged in at all time , it doe n't do much to dissuade the social example of people posting work update on Slack at 11pm 
Work/life balance on occasion 
Departments empire building , then sitting around playing game instead of working 
Navigating through discipline swap can be difficult 
Even though we dont do super grind weeks/months/years there have been period of this 
This can be difficult for some folk to juggle , but it ’ s very helpful to yourself , team , product , etc 
Cons Have to work irregular hour to cover for other time zone , especially in PR Poor treatment and awareness for female employee and harassment allegation Nepotism , even in game design department ( Valorant , R & D ) Poor awareness and disregard for business strategy with proven discriminatory nation and leader ( NEOM partnership ) , press will listen to you more than company will Boss feedback is rare unless negative Development team ( Valorant ) have to fight to get update on feature Lots of overseas coordination can get exhausting Despite PR blitz to show they are changing and provide a safer work place , it ’ s mostly a corporate front for outside eye looking in Company ’ s vision for future doe not inspire confidence 
really exhausting after year developing more secure system , timeconsuming job 
People voicing that they 're burnt out when they only put a solid 3-4 hour of work in during a day drove me up the wall 
work life balance depends on the which team you are in 
Some of the most entitled people I 've ever worked with and lot of people waste time playing game , but miss their deadline 
Everything depends on your team 
Does n't always do everything for employee Has a hard time getting code out to player Tends to over-value pedigree from ivy league and mba 
Most Rioters work very hard , but there are obvious case where lazy or not-useful Rioters are coasting 
* Along the same line of the first con , we have n't figured out yet how to be a multi-game studio 
You 'll be expected to find way to be productive and make awesome happen without always being told how 
* need to find your work / life balance , which is encouraged but not always reality depending on what you work on 
Depending on the role of course , it is not too hectic though , most people have a balanced routine * not a lot of direction or coaching on day to day which can be hard for junior role 
Then , out of the blue I wa laid off 
The takeaway ? As long a you perform well in your role it doe n't matter how you treated Rioters 4 year ago 
This person is clearly very productive and well regarded those she work with 
That can be pretty anxiety-inducing if you 're a newer employee and do n't know exactly where you stand ( the same is true of work/life balance more generally ) 
The League team is only a small portion of Riot , what is everyone else doing ? 
Work/life balance can be hard to maintain , especially during crunch period 
* We sometimes get stretched thin , and have trouble killing effort that probably should be consolidated 
The level of productivity one experience on a given day is alarmingly low , and the ratio of useful people to useless people is similar 
But the industry and time change a doe development 
Ya got ta keep the light on basically 
The issue with this is that all good thing come to an end and if you ca n't make a new product then having the studio in one of the most expensive area in the United States start to be a big problem 
Otherwise expect to drive 2-3 hour into work 
At one point Riot let you do whatever you wanted with little demand for business result ; that era is ending and a lot of Rioters are n't happy about it 
Too many loose end on people managment 
I ’ ve had high-performing colleague who have switched off of new game team of their own volition because they were bored due to lack of work 
There is so much work to do , that you could literally not go home 
You really have to self regulate yourself 
[LISTSEP]
If you do n't build a feel-good relationship with specific senior manager you will not thrive 
Senior management tends to hire people a Rioters fast that are not even gamers or try to recruit within the company just cause they urgently need someone to fill the position a they have other plan in mind , which literally lead to a corruption of value 
Mobbing in form of re-positioning without asking or talking , being isolated from project on purpose without reason nor consent , asking for overworking , not listening nor caring about serious complaint , chitchatting in an unprofessional way are real and condoned by upper management 
Senior Leadership 
extremely long hour on a daily basis for anyone who is not in upper management 
Playing game ( even LoL ) wa frowned upon by high management 
Compensation is very slow coming , and senior management ha become out of touch with daily work 
Senior Leaders have forgotten how to play a support leadership role 
I have repeatedly experienced group and senior leader at Riot who too heavily weigh decision based off of their desire for Riot to appear to be a AAA company , a opposed to what will be best for our player 
‘ old guard ’ leadership still kind of stick around without providing much direction 
accountability is weird , since exec leadership is kind of checked out 
Company leadership is struggling to find it 's path 
Lack of vision from senior leadership , unclear accountability and bad management make the shipping of new game hard 
* No vision nor strategy from senior leadership 
All leadership team are new to managing a company this size and no one is willing to step down and let the real experienced folk come in and help ( except the two founder 
This meant a lot of inexperience leader in senior role 
mentor ) to turn to for help 
This can and doe create quite a bit of negative perception on them , their manager etc 
Leadership is Opaque 
The leadership at Riot is rarely transparent , and there 's generally a lot of secrecy and hush-hush surrounding strategic goal of the company a well a R & D project 
This includes Senior Leadership with an emphasis on cronyism , rocking the boat is viewed a being misaligned , senior leadership being misaligned with everyone else , poor compensation , and optimized for extrovert are all real and ongoing problem and sadly have gotten worse over the past year or two 
It is seen a un-riotous to ask for more money and senior leadership often stonewalls monetary request 
The senior level management do n't really want to hear your opinion on something , because their way is the best way 
Riot is going on that path with the current leadership team 
Senior leadership is the layer of cancer that infects the rest of the company 
Do not bother bringing to their attention the problem you 've experienced ; they 'll just run you around conducting interview and not actually address the issue , especially if you have a grievance towards one specific person and that person ha a powerful manager 
Leadership is void of empathy and love to spin everything so that you 're part of the problem when you bring something up 
It 's a very simple , easy defense tactic from higher-up , and it 's employed frequently 
Managers who openly admit they should n't be managing people 
And why do these people stay manager ? Because they 're friend with the right people 
Constantly re-organizing , leaving senior management not always on the same page 
There are definitely leader in the company , but they often provide guidance without definitive direction or a solid yes or no 
Riot ha some deeply incompetent senior leader that the C level executive refuse to fire despite feedback feom entire department , and even multiple report for misconduct 
I do n't know what kind of dirt they have on the CEO , but it must be something ! This incompetence manifest itself in a total chaos where literally no one know what the hell is going on 
At time the reporting structure ha been especially overloaded with manager having 20+ report 
Many senior leader call the Kotaku article `` blown out of proportion '' or `` just a case of a few bad manager 
Discussions of how people are feeling have been all but squelched by a `` no rumor milling , no discussion of the lawsuit '' gag order instituted by the CEO 
Management ha done a good job of hiring senior leader who have lead big organization a of late , but a good chunk of the staff feel junior 
What pass for autonomy here is a lot of theoretical talk about possible direction we can go among the mass at Riot , but the actual decision are all still made in closed door meeting between product owner and top leader 
There 's a real sense that no one at the top really understands which of our early decision caused our success and which were the decision we succeeded in spite of , so many of our leader are afraid to make the kind of bold decision we need to raise quality to where we want it 
Many mid to upper level manager are inexperienced and/or insensitive , causing pocket of poor morale and pattern of avoidance 
This happens regularly to higher end employee , I 'd suspect because of intimidation 
[ - ] Management upgrade incomplete – The exec team is struggling to build a layer of trusted and strategically aligned manager that they can rely on to act in a way that ’ s consistent with their vision 
That 's only something that can be fixed from the top 
You 've got senior manager in the room who have only ever worked at one company ( Riot ) , on one game ( League of Legends ) , in one role ( for which they were maybe qualified for when the company wa 40 employee but no longer ) , who are making judgment like `` I feel this candidate would make a decent Associate XYZ , but certainly ha some growth left before being Senior XYZ 
In this example , the candidate wa a Project Director at Microsoft with 10 year industry experience ( longer than the existence of Riot Games ) with a stellar track record prior applying for a Senior Manager production role at Riot 
A large percentage of senior leader have either checked out entirely , or are fearful of change a it could topple their power structure 
Though rare , when thing go wrong for the Rioters these leader support , they really go awry 
Leaders are n't engaging with one another to build trust 
Senior leadership prefers a `` hand off '' approach that emphasizes individual and team autonomy but ha n't provided enough guidance on what good look like , so showmanship is sometimes mistaken for merit 
Even though Riot ’ s identified this weakness and have prioritized hiring leader in these key role , there ’ s lot of chaos between manager , and team are severely undermanaged a a result until we ’ re able to find and put those senior leader in place 
I worry that because of their senior role they will poison their group , but go undetected because of their effectiveness at managing up 
There is a constant turn-over of leadership with little direction of the vision 
Many management level make it difficult to get any game-changing , significant change done to existing system 
Finally , if you are single and willing to room with others or if you are hired a a senior leadership you may be able to afford living in the area 
At time the reporting structure ha been especially overloaded with manager having 20+ report 
Poop and swoop feedback is a real problem here and it 's not just from the upper management 
I work smarter , not harder now , and I owe a lot of that to what I learned from senior management and my coworkers 
Leadership is not unified on the goal of the company and everyone is acting in their own interest 
The male manager got it worse 
) than many other game studio and the software industry at large , there 's a ton of straight white dude and almost the entire senior management are straight white dude 
Shortage of senior leader , and many inexperienced manager creates some headache , but managed really well 
What pass for autonomy here is a lot of theoretical talk about possible direction we can go among the mass at Riot , but the actual decision are all still made in closed door meeting between product owner and top leader 
There 's a real sense that no one at the top really understands which of our early decision caused our success and which were the decision we succeeded in spite of , so many of our leader are afraid to make the kind of bold decision we need to raise quality to where we want it 
Many mid to upper level manager are inexperienced and/or insensitive , causing pocket of poor morale and pattern of avoidance 
Executive level leader 
Often you can find multiple layer of management ( including the top ) who have no idea what is going on and who stonewall progress because good idea aren ’ t theirs 
Acquisitions are poorly integrated and seem like boondoggle for our senior leader and finance team rather than genuine way of extending our product or reach 
This ha most recently manifested in an entire layer of leadership hired in above existing employee 
[ + ] Inner circle : As a consequence of our rampant growth , the visiblity that upper management ha of the day-to-day in the trench and the access employee have to upper management ha naturally gone down 
But the President of the United States ha a Cabinet for a reason 
It made for an awkward and unpleasant event , compounded by senior management 's seeming obliviousness to the issue 
current leader are often stretched thin 
[ - ] Management upgrade incomplete – The exec team is struggling to build a layer of trusted and strategically aligned manager that they can rely on to act in a way that ’ s consistent with their vision 
executive take no responsibility , what a toxic company 
upper management without competency 
Lack of accountability and diversity in senior management , especially in Europe 
High level are not professional , most time they do n't even know how to keep project running , and keep making it employee feel bad 
Problems with senior leadership and decision making , inaccuracy in providing feedback 
The current CEO , Nicolo is a good person , who ultimately care a lot about the company and the employee , but doe n't have what it take to lead 
Now , the truth of this is : this really mostly matter if you 're director level up 
It matter for director up because you 're the one who have to deal with this level of top-level incompetence 
but it 's way too slow and poorly executed and just a failure of the top leadership team 
The thing is there is no true top-leadership team , it 's just a collection of some mostly great leader that do n't have empowerment , it 's just the Nicolo show 
Inexperienced , rapidly changing manager who are held to low standard ; from the c-suite on down 
It 's incredibly ironic and hypocritical to see principal engineer at Riot give talk about being 10x engineer and how communication and empathy are so important to being a good engineer , and not see any of that from their own team 
Leadership fail upwards 
CEO could n't be more disconnected from the player experience 
Some scandal in upper management from crazy day need to be properly sorted and not brushed under the rug 
It may also feel like upper management is out of touch with Rioters at time 
The MMO is good enough a a goal for now , but for some of the big picture goal that the leadership team ha been saying for year , Riot is not taking the big bet required to get there because there is not a concrete vision 
Executives often end up with their foot in their mouth 
Poor upper management Lack of pay transparency 
There is a lack of accountability throughout , especially in Senior and Executive Leadership , which is evidenced by Publishing becoming so powerful despite being the worst-performing area of the company for year ( and they defunded the team that were supposed to measure their performance ) , but yet their leader just keep getting more power 
If you want to progress to VP and above , be prepared to be political but look , this go for most company so that ’ s just life , but it seems to have become worse since the CEO change 
The executive team have empowered the vocal minority ( i 
many good leader , upper management layer ( who carried the company despite the weak executive layer ) and ICs ( i 
leadership lack vision 
Company leadership is struggling to find it 's path 
A group of original people who started at Riot with minimal outside experience have been promoted to director/VP level 
Riot doe n't do a great job at aligning goal from the front line up to the CEO 
If a leader is at fault , problem are usually not addressed without anything short of a public outcry 
This is endemic to Riot 's senior leadership across so many front , it hard to count 
There is constant infighting between all of the departmental leader across Riot 
Leadership also tends to claim that we have the `` secret sauce '' but no real idea what it actually is , which lead to sitting around twiddling our thumb 
People who come forward with complaint or story about discrimination tend to get brushed off a `` poor culture fit '' or `` not core gamers '' ( including by senior leadership ) 
Senior leadership is the layer of cancer that infects the rest of the company 
Do not bother bringing to their attention the problem you 've experienced ; they 'll just run you around conducting interview and not actually address the issue , especially if you have a grievance towards one specific person and that person ha a powerful manager 
Leadership is void of empathy and love to spin everything so that you 're part of the problem when you bring something up 
It 's a very simple , easy defense tactic from higher-up , and it 's employed frequently 
Riot ha some deeply incompetent senior leader that the C level executive refuse to fire despite feedback feom entire department , and even multiple report for misconduct 
I do n't know what kind of dirt they have on the CEO , but it must be something ! This incompetence manifest itself in a total chaos where literally no one know what the hell is going on 
executive take no responsibility , what a toxic company 
Many senior leader call the Kotaku article `` blown out of proportion '' or `` just a case of a few bad manager 
Discussions of how people are feeling have been all but squelched by a `` no rumor milling , no discussion of the lawsuit '' gag order instituted by the CEO 
Riot is going on that path with the current leadership team 
The outlook remains hopeful though , a senior leadership ha remained largely transparent , mature , and clear-headed throughout the change 
Executive leadership now in place is absolutely not capable of inspiring and leading the amazing talent at Riot 
-Company made sacrifice to get early senior management and now you 're left with very inexperienced people in senior roll which stifle employee growth 
This happens regularly to higher end employee , I 'd suspect because of intimidation 
Leaders are n't engaging with one another to build trust 
The “ D20 , ” what we call the senior leader who report into the three new executive head , are an interesting group 
Again , the new leadership is starting too look at normal consideration like ROI and margin when making decision 
The senior leadership , especially , doe n't take negative feedback very well , and is extremely good at dancing around issue and using their political skill 
Favoritism is a big issue in the company , a lot of people in the senior leadership are not qualified for their job and , despite their constant failure at what they 're doing ( and a lot of people under them having a hard time/losing their job ) , keep their position because they 're buddy with the owner 
New senior leadership still adjusting to their role , and still working toward articulating a resonant mission which can plausibly capitalize on Riot 's unique strategic advantage 
senior leadership is risk averse and lack diversity 
Often you can find multiple layer of management ( including the top ) who have no idea what is going on and who stonewall progress because good idea aren ’ t theirs 
Acquisitions are poorly integrated and seem like boondoggle for our senior leader and finance team rather than genuine way of extending our product or reach 
[LISTSEP]
Career opportunity are blocked by manager and only been advertised in the company when there is an urgent need for it 
Game industry is pretty small in Hong Kong 
If you are somehow leaving this company , it could be hard for you to get the same quality job in Hong Kong 
Hiring 
recruitment and hiring is painfully slow 
some very young people in management position with no formal training 
inexperienced manager 
The turnover rate is high ! 
Everyone owns their own career and self-development 
Turnover is so high 
Difficult recruitment process 
We only have a couple of artist , still no QA department , etc… This mean heavy reliance on external vendor and a lot of time on recruiting and building team 
Riot will expect you to come and build your team 
——— International Recruiting ——— Most of our recruiting is international ( meaning out of Hong Kong ) 
• Being a regional office , we have very limited opportunity for career growth 
You really need to be able to tie your satisfaction to your output , not your job title or management opportunity 
Recruitment Process 
The recruitment process can be incredibly brutal 
If you are looking for a data and process driven work environment with people telling you what to do and when to do it , you probably wont fit the majority of role at Riot 
If you are single and going for an entry level role , chance are you will have to find a flatmate if you want to live close to work 
-- -- Foreign management 
I honestly ca n't think of any con involved in working at Riot 
Recruiting and onboarding process could be improved even more 
Contract/internship hiring is badly defined , forcing contract worker to continue pestering management for a chance to get hired full time 
Too Many `` Chefs '' in the kitchen in too many aspect of technical direction 
Huge variance in quality of managers/leaders mean you roll the dice on whether you get a good or bad one , and bad one can set your career back year 
Someone ha to quit , or be fired to create a vertical slot for growth and it 's likely it 'll be filled by a new hire , not an existing rioter 
Horizontal ( breadth ) growth is difficult to achieve , there 's a very large risk of getting stuck doing one thing for over 5 year and getting type cast into a role 
I have never had a worse work experience than I did at Riot Games 
I felt like I wa back in high school being picked on again working at Riot Games 
-Product Riot is the name for the group of support initiative and team ( Talent , Facilities , IT , etc 
Over the past year , an influx of culturally misaligned hire pea-cocking , and seemingly here only to pad their resume 
Lack of future leadership identification/growth program 
Riot doe n't yet have a program or process for identifying future leader and ensuring their growth and development within the company 
As a result , Riot risk losing top talent that can not find way to grow beyond their current role 
Perhaps this come from lot of Rioters making truckloads of money when Tencent bought the company , but whatever it is , it feel like there is too much complacency 
Some Rioters , particularly those who have never worked a `` real job , '' do not seem to appreciate what Riot offer them 
Fast growth and very discerning hiring practice meant a lot of fairly junior existing leader had to step up to the challenge and take the biggest role of their career 
in managing people , in org design , in product/process , etc 
Lack of career guidance / path to promotion Large personality dominate meeting Knowing the right person is more important than having the best idea Open office layout is often loud , chaotic 
Do n't exit employee fast enough 
Riot went through a hyper growth phase where hiring decision were very rushed ; this resulted in a wide band of talent , very hit or miss 
A lot of manager have never been manager before , and some are afraid that the people they 're managing will overtake them or make them look stupid , so a lot of brilliant talent end up finding other opportunity , leaving only the insecure manager and resulting in a cyclical decline in talent density 
The intern experience can vary vastly depending on the position/department they are working in 
Worst company ever and it make me wonder who is writing the positive review ? The current recruiting team ! 
-No vision -Recruiting suck ( but that 's because management tell them to suck ) -They have an F rating with the BBB 
You 're a Rioter 
Difficult to find mentor for position above an associate level 
Riot Games only ha one product , which lead to diminished opportunity and limited career growth 
I would say Riot 's biggest fault is that many career growth path are not well defined 
This issue is exacerbated by the fact that Riot strives to hire very talented , ambitious people 
( Game a a service , esports , talent-focused value ) 
They discriminate against woman and damage career 
You work the title for a year first , with no actual path for promotion 
Own your own career sound great but is an excuse to not train manager who have no idea how to mentor or direct 
But it also mean opportunity for people to adapt , change role and expand the scope are ever more present 
The hiring bar today isn ’ t what it wa 5 or even two year ago 
Temps can work over 5 year without being offered an in house position 
It is incredible how many incompetent , unproven people have risen their way through the rank just from smooth talking and agreeing with the people around them 
More and more `` mercenary '' are being hired who are looking to not do much and take a lot of credit 
Your career at Riot will end if you rock the boat , even when it 's clearly coming from a good place ( like being player-focused ) 
Trust is not widely available and there are too many stakeholder at any given point , so do n't expect to come out of this job with a resume with tangible deliverable 
Riot is a great place for a first job , if you 're fresh out of college or an internship 
For seasoned professional it 's a guaranteed way to take three step back in your career 
There are SO MANY manager with NO experience managing people 
Your manager will change frequently 
Good luck getting that Director-level marketing job at your dream company when , despite multiple decade of work experience and successful campaign , your resume is questioned because your Riot year have you listed a a mere `` medium specialist '' or some other nonsense 
There 's also nowhere to go with your career at Riot 
If you want to move up , you need to wait for someone to vacate a position because there just is n't any new business at Riot 
-Career Growth : Although this is starting to be more solidified , there is no corporate rank structure or promotion guideline 
HIRING : This company think it 's great at hiring but it 's actually trash-tier at it 
Engineers and programmer are wasted on using such old tech 
Managers and lead will not meet with them to help figure out what to do to grow in the company 
Feeling the pain of transitioning from a one-hit-wonder into something more sustainable and professional 
No one is going to pick you up and put you in the awesome promotion you want to be in 
This ha lead to junior Rioters without sufficient mentoring 
This not the place for everyone , hence the long process for recruitment 
A number of long time employee are finally leaving the company after the recent Tencent buy out , and pursuing other opportunity 
One of the last area this exists is the HR/Talent org , where they are , and have been working like crazy to get thing running smooth 
Things like internal communication , finance and recruiting are still struggling to scale with the rest of the company , struggling to create and implement process across the entire org 
It 's also not for everyone , if you 're at the point in your career where you 're looking for a resting spot for a few year , Riot is not that place 
This get exacerbated by the fact that many early , junior Rioters get promoted into leadership position , because Rioters conflate people management with prestige 
Career opportunity vary greatly across department , and sometimes opportunity that are great for the company get derailed because they are great for the department or team 
Your career will suffer if you plan on implementing modern tech or want to advance your resume in technical prowess 
Be prepared to work on decade old apps/configs and bad code that 's dumped in your lap from the supposed `` architect '' employee that have been around since ~2008-2010 
But it 's not malicious , but instead feedback that help me not make the same mistake twice = ) Your career growth is in your own hand 
Be prepared to learn a whole new set of tool and skill if you change team 
* Most position require an extremely strong resume and/or quite a bit of work experience to qualify for 
Very few truly entry level position 
Overbearing control around brand perception can make some player-facing role really unappealing 
Best place to work ! 
League of Legends growth curve created tech , people , and organizational debt 
Vague/unclear direction and strategy coming from above Leaders are not held accountable for mistake unless they 're public Leaders are not rewarded for success Biases run rampant when gauging employee performance No growth opportunity or training for leader Discipline health is inconsistent , leadership discipline are especially volatile and do n't prioritize investing in their report 
if you are n't passionate about video game , many role here would be challenging 
Once people have established you a someone `` junior , '' on your team , it 's difficult to reverse that perception in a way that allows for increased career opportunity 
Additionally , Riot being an awesome place to work also mean that people never really want to leave 
* Some lack of people in middle management 
We 're overly focused on hiring over internal promotion The discipline leader are so focused on desperately hiring a fast a possible , that they are n't nurturing their existing team properly 
If you are currently being wooed by Riot recruiter , enjoy it 
There is no clear path to promotion , and it 's rare to hear about them 
Riot is so obsessed with hiring , that it is ignoring the stagnant compensation of it 's existing team 
Would not recommend any job at Riot if you do n't love video game 
Lack of development experience at the top and bleeds down to the bottom 
Artists that claim others work get promoted to lead while actually good strong devs who know what they are doing are forced out because frankly there is a large amount of people who do n't realize that game development is a job 
It ’ s really hard for example to find core gamers who are also really great at < insert esoteric professional skill > , so the company ha had to loosen some of it standard with regard to hiring people who genuinely love game and can be termed core gamers 
These hire may assimilate just fine 
Or they may go on to hire additional people who don ’ t game , thus sending u down the long , slippery slope towards becoming another < insert game company full of people who don ’ t play or care about game > 
A lot of work , still need to hire more people , but anyone can move the company forward 
One fact you need to understand should you happen to work in the publishing group and potentially any other group in the company : this is a production driven company 
Producers , Product Owners , and Project Managers are the deciders 
When I first started at Riot Games , I wa like awesome , a game company 
So , if you want to work here 
I do n't recommend working at Riot Games unless you are new to the corporate world , meaning you do n't have any prior corporate experience 
Maybe you can join for a year , just to get them on your resume 
Oh , and if you 're trying to move up in a company , it 's not going to happen at Riot Games unless you come in a a manager 
But if you 're going to management you better be ready to deal with a load of ambiguous politics and be willing to follow order without making wave 
The single biggest issue with Riot is poor management that refuse to leave because of the lack of liquidity ( and ca n't be fired because they are great at blowing smoke ) 
Want to do big thing ? Go join a startup instead 
Bonus tip for female candidate : ask during your interview how many female senior leader are in the company ( zero ) , and then consider how far you are going to rise beyond junior/mid level 
Hiring feel SLOW 
This is a positive in principle , but I think the company could do more to arm new Rioters with some practical tool & technique 
The work-life here is intense and the expectation are intense 
Engineering Managers seem to be hit or miss 
Bullies hired and kept on team , and allowed to harass good talented worker constantly , causing turnover and lost career 
Constant overworking and extreme effort to over achieve , only to earn little to nothing in the form of promotion or clout over a long period of time , while other `` favorite people '' constantly get more and more promotion and clout 
Managers giving unclear guideline for career development and changing guideline randomly Unequal treatment of woman : 
If you 've ever been a part of the interviewing panel at Riot , it becomes abundantly clear where the hiring delay come from 
Working at Riot in any position higher than entry level is a political minefield 
Influence and relationship capital mean more than merit , and your career at Riot can come crashing to a halt because you wrote one email with a little too much brevity and offended a sensitive lifer 
Almost all role require that you relocate to Santa Monica 
Nepotism is pretty rampant in various part of the org 
However , the company 's location pretty much provides two option for an employee : 1 
* There is n't enough middle-management to go around 
Managers are overtaxed and have too many report , which mean that individual own even more of their own career than wa perhaps intended 
it is n't horrible , but if Riot really want to recruit Google level talent , we need to shell out Google level money 
Most senior leader surround themselves with yes-man only and challenging the wrong leader can effectively end your career at Riot 
Because leadership and management responsibility are essentially given out to whomever asks for them the loudest , career guidance wa a problem 
As you grow at Riot , your manager WILL give you more responsibility 
I feel like a lot of people give Riot harsh review because this is their first job in the industry and do n't know what to expect or do n't know how to say no 
If you do join , I guarantee there will be at least one code base you despise working in , BUT 
Management is , in general , very slim and is n't well supported 
Any other discipline and you 're not in luck 
Leadership gap : Our hiring philosophy tends to favor hiring those with growth for potential over raw talent 
Professionalism : Maybe this is a sign that I ’ m a curmudgeon , but Rioters are rowdy 
There is a high level of nepotism still at the company which mean people who were great during the start-up phase are underwater now that the company is larger 
Also , until more title come out there is n't really any room for career growth 
The organization is flat which also mean there are n't any open position a LoL is pretty mature in it structure 
I had people on my team who had been there for 3+ year who were bursting for change but could n't afford to move 
There is extreme attrition for `` open feedback '' and career growth discussion with manager 
Be prepared to learn a whole new set of tool and skill if you change team 
* Most position require an extremely strong resume and/or quite a bit of work experience to qualify for 
Very few truly entry level position 
This ha lead to junior Rioters without sufficient mentoring 
Additionally , Riot being an awesome place to work also mean that people never really want to leave 
* You need to be highly motivated and willing to self-start / learn on the job 
If you are looking for feedback , coaching or mentor-ship beyond entry level , wrong place for you Compensation for some role is abysmal for the cost of living in Santa Monica Breakdown : Riot solicits review from people frequently for this site 
given that your first 3 month are a great period of glee and high-five and that they are hiring like mad , not surprised by the positive skew 
Granted , relationship management is a key part of succeeding at a job , the skew however for Riot is far more towards relationship and popularity with the right clique 
If you do n't find a mentor at time you can feel lost ( you are responsible to find your own , and drive the relationship ) Loud work space Some ppl play too many game , you wonder if they actually work Riot Games is located in a high cost of living area There ha yet to be a lot of growth into mgmt , often time hired from the outside 
But it 's not malicious , but instead feedback that help me not make the same mistake twice = ) Your career growth is in your own hand 
Lack of mentorship 
Lack of a regular review process can leave people in salary/promotion limbo Stock plan is a carrot with loophole that can hurt people that voluntarily leave No Bonus plan 
They moved to different department and were promoted 
The manager who did the harassing wa kind of reprimanded ( for other reason ) /promoted 
This is a place to grow and evolve , not just a place to work at 
Lack of carreer planning : some influential people grows fast , others are stuck even if they work hard 
* Hiring take forever ( usually month ) * Recent management transition ( Marc and Brandon have stepped down and have been replaced by Nicolo Laurent , Dylan Jadeja , and Scott Gelb 
Once people have established you a someone `` junior , '' on your team , it 's difficult to reverse that perception in a way that allows for increased career opportunity 
We 're overly focused on hiring over internal promotion The discipline leader are so focused on desperately hiring a fast a possible , that they are n't nurturing their existing team properly

Compensation/ Promotions 
I 'm a fairly young developer 
I got into the company early , and wa able to grow and get a few promotion along the way 
I know some who took demotion or paycuts when they joined Riot 
One fact you need to understand should you happen to work in the publishing group and potentially any other group in the company : this is a production driven company 
Producers , Product Owners , and Project Managers are the deciders 
No one is going to pick you up and put you in the awesome promotion you want to be in 
It is really hard to call out any particular team or discipline a there are people in all discipline who work selflessly , but the people who normally get ahead are those that are friend with senior management or who are directly hired into position they are n't any more qualified for than people currently in the organization 
Development tool , especially for content creator , are simply not a high priority 
Long hour , extremely underpaid , revolving door of employee 
the 'weird doll ' room meant someone wa getting fired and it happened frequently since they pull talent in from many different state 
The one that remain were clearly one that could `` punch above their weight '' when hired , and have been working on one of the most successful game in the world for year 
We are now able to recruit `` big name '' from elsewhere in the industry , and we put a lot of effort and creativity into wooing and recruiting them 
A lot of work , still need to hire more people , but anyone can move the company forward 
* Bait and switch employment 
It ’ s really hard for example to find core gamers who are also really great at < insert esoteric professional skill > , so the company ha had to loosen some of it standard with regard to hiring people who genuinely love game and can be termed core gamers 
These hire may assimilate just fine 
Or they may go on to hire additional people who don ’ t game , thus sending u down the long , slippery slope towards becoming another < insert game company full of people who don ’ t play or care about game > 
nepotism is not uncommon 
slander to future employer 
Lack of career guidance / path to promotion Large personality dominate meeting Knowing the right person is more important than having the best idea Open office layout is often loud , chaotic 
It is really easy to get stuck in a department or field and not be able to get out 
As you grow at Riot , your manager WILL give you more responsibility 
I feel like a lot of people give Riot harsh review because this is their first job in the industry and do n't know what to expect or do n't know how to say no 
If you do join , I guarantee there will be at least one code base you despise working in , BUT 
Long hour Occasional travel required Limited room for promotion 
i just had a career change 
Constant Change Lack of local career path 
Unclear career development path , lack of training , leadership management 
Work 
Career progress depends on hitting a good manager that really care for your growth 
short deadline , Thank you for doing your part to keep Glassdoor the most trusted place to find a job and company you love 
Offers better opportunity for those working at the headquarters 
I honestly ca n't think of any con involved in working at Riot 
-- -- Foreign management 
Recruitment Process 
The recruitment process can be incredibly brutal 
If you are looking for a data and process driven work environment with people telling you what to do and when to do it , you probably wont fit the majority of role at Riot 
If you are single and going for an entry level role , chance are you will have to find a flatmate if you want to live close to work 
Office politics are very real , despite a claim for meritocracy 
Under his leadership he ha further eroded accountability and ha not furthered `` reward '' for `` risk '' -- people internally ask themselves `` why should I bust-ass for Riot ? why do n't I just go somewhere else to gain more upside or grow ? '' 
If you 're an incredible IC or Senior , that want to make game and you 've got a dream job on League , well then take it 
There are no plan to have growth , no true mentorship , no skip-level investment 
You only advance when someone else leaf or by luck of the constant incompetent org shuffle 
HR & Finance , etc 
Launch cycle is too slow and can take up 50 % of gaming career 
a neverending open headcount limited full-time opportunity for contractor convoluted interview process and recruiting system 
Growth Opportunities for people who work outside of HQ 
Needs improvement when it come to hiring strong leader on game team ( especially in product management ) 
Very toxic fanbase , regularly harassing developer online -Work is often very repetitive , although that largely depends on the role -Teams are disproportionately made up of `` lifer '' and people with no prior industry experience , leading to a frustrating echo chamber of idea especially to anyone coming in with prior experience at a large studio -Riot ( especially League ) is looked down upon by many AAA studio and if you 're there for a long time it can be difficult to find new work in AAA 
The number of meeting for a creative role is insane , easily up to 20 hour worth of meeting in a week or more even a a mid level 
Management in the creative discipline is treated a an addon 
When it come to career advancement the phrase `` what have you done for me lately '' should have the Riot logo next to it in the Dictionary 
Internal politics and political correctness drive many decision on filling new role and promoting existing employee 
Pay band and change to job architecture , particularly for technology/engineering , are causing many high performer to exit the company 
Discrimination , bullying behavior , bad manager , no career progress 
In closing , if you ’ re reading this and thinking about joining Riot , it really depends on the area you ’ re joining and it leadership 
Focus on work 
Many of the people I see join now are being hired to come in and do a specific job instead of being hired to level u up 
See a great job opportunity on another team that you think you could do ? Well the first question will be , `` have you ever done this role ? '' If not 
No downside to working here 
not easy to get promoted 
Not always the easiest to move up but they 've made some change to job level that might help with that 
can be stuck in decision making process , career path not so clear 
Terrible management in some team , poor learning and development so those boss never level up 
God help you if you 're stuck with one of the bad manager , you 're career will be stonewalled forever 
We reorg so often that I 've known people who have had more manager than year they 've been working here 
HIRING : This company think it 's great at hiring but it 's actually trash-tier at it 
Challenging getting ahead ( I wa a short term contract position though ) 
* Career opportunity & advancement is very ambiguous 
* You need to be highly motivated and willing to self-start / learn on the job 
HR/Talent is a dysfunctional organization 
The single biggest issue with Riot is poor management that refuse to leave because of the lack of liquidity ( and ca n't be fired because they are great at blowing smoke ) 
Want to do big thing ? Go join a startup instead 
Bonus tip for female candidate : ask during your interview how many female senior leader are in the company ( zero ) , and then consider how far you are going to rise beyond junior/mid level 
Most senior leader surround themselves with yes-man only and challenging the wrong leader can effectively end your career at Riot 
It is incredible how many incompetent , unproven people have risen their way through the rank just from smooth talking and agreeing with the people around them 
More and more `` mercenary '' are being hired who are looking to not do much and take a lot of credit 
Your career at Riot will end if you rock the boat , even when it 's clearly coming from a good place ( like being player-focused ) 
Trust is not widely available and there are too many stakeholder at any given point , so do n't expect to come out of this job with a resume with tangible deliverable 
They completely disregarded a woman who left in my dept who called sexism when she and I were both overlooked for a position that wa then given to a man who had 2 
They refused to answer why he wa given this role when he clearly had far le experience than both she and I 
He would then claim he just forgot to mention it ( when it significantly would affect how I worked with the team ) 
They told me they were open to finding me a better role and then 3 separate time got started and then shot down the idea 
You work the title for a year first , with no actual path for promotion 
Long hour Occasional travel required Limited room for promotion 
I would say Riot 's biggest fault is that many career growth path are not well defined 
This issue is exacerbated by the fact that Riot strives to hire very talented , ambitious people 
They discriminate against woman and damage career 
( Game a a service , esports , talent-focused value ) 
Elitist vibe/standards can make getting a job ( and building a team ) here unnecessarily difficult , and can lead to people experiencing a persistent `` outsider syndrome '' ( e 
assuming they 're the least smart/talented person in the room , and worrying about their future employment ) 
Company is scaling quickly : Not necessarily a con , but you 'll need to be adaptable and interested in learning and growing to be successful at Riot 
Growing from 60 people to 1500 come with a lot of challenge , so understanding your own strength and weakness , and having career goal go a long way to adapting to the company a it matures 
Now that executive management doe n't know everybody intimately ( thanks to rapid growth ) , a fair , transparent system that work very well will be needed so that the mass of people hired over the last 18 month get adequate coaching and career advancement 
Company growth outpaces learning regularly 
-Poor hiring decision have brought in highly talented people with narcissistic personality 
-No progress ha been made since my 2 year here to make the employee want to work at Riot except our rapid growth 
My only wish is that they 're on-ramp program ( DeNewb ) for contractor is extensive a it is for full-timers 
Lack of development experience at the top and bleeds down to the bottom 
Artists that claim others work get promoted to lead while actually good strong devs who know what they are doing are forced out because frankly there is a large amount of people who do n't realize that game development is a job 
Confusion about career growth / pathing across discipline , which is strange considering Riot boast a focus on talent and team 
People who have been here for a long time and have traversed multiple role have had to do so with a sort of vagabond , pave your own way mentality 
If you 're planning on building a portfolio , go somewhere else 
One of the last area this exists is the HR/Talent org , where they are , and have been working like crazy to get thing running smooth 
Things like internal communication , finance and recruiting are still struggling to scale with the rest of the company , struggling to create and implement process across the entire org 
It 's also not for everyone , if you 're at the point in your career where you 're looking for a resting spot for a few year , Riot is not that place 
Feeling the pain of transitioning from a one-hit-wonder into something more sustainable and professional 
[LISTSEP]
so no quick decision or mess Average salary ( you expect more from top gaming company ) Too many meeting 
No reviews/pay increase Benefits are poor Most senior Managment like to talk but not listen Pay is just bad Riot expects fanatic fanboy loyalty but doesnt do anything to earn it 
Pay 
With the amount of responsibility that land in the lap of each employee , salary should be in the rock star range 
Huge variance in pay between discipline compound pay difference between those doing the work and those not contributing ( you may find a QA/Release/Product/Delivery person working 5 time a hard a an engineering technical leader paid half what that leader is paid ) 
Some people take the perk for granted , or feel like all process is bad so we should do whatever we want , which lead to some entitlement that can be very frustrating 
after being too distracted by their own investment outside of Riot and messing up the company 's next big opportunity ) * Quality of hire ha been deteriorating because the pay ha took a big hit after acquisition 
It used to advertise itself pay like a tech company but 's it 's no longer true when the HR team designed an internally controversial and unattractive vesting cash bonus plan 
Most job do not offer free lunch and dinner , allow you to play game at work , unlimited free specialty coffee drink , basketball court on campus , etc 
Compensation : Perhaps one reason a large amount of the company feel so entitled is the pay at Riot is about 20-35 % le than competitor in west LA , if you are below senior leadership level 
Your ability to negotiate pay raise is extraordinarily difficult 
What make this so much worse than it appears at first glance is the number of senior people who are compensated very well for the work they did year ago and now coast by making so very much more than the rest of u while doing le work 
Perks : Many perk which people took for granted year ago are dwindling or gone 
These lost perk include : WeRiot yearly vacation , unlocked game account , equity in the company , ability to negotiate compensation package , trip to conference or event like PAX , and the ability to switch team to focus on what you are passionate about are all gone or almost gone 
The small percentage of employee who do n't appreciate everything the company provides 
This is n't necessarily an awful thing , but there is an expectation that `` Riot will take care of me no matter what I want to do '' and `` Riot owes me a certain quality of life '' that reek of tech entitlement 
Bad management , silo team with overlapping responsibility , one of the worst compensation system a such a sizable company , inexperienced and bro mgmt team ( D20 ) 
Salary is also based on 50 hour work week 
It 's great to have access to snacks/meals , swag , event , cool tech equipment , and a beautiful campus 
or a free piece of swag wa a different color than they were expecting 
They would complain that their fun team offsite event did n't have an open bar , or that their manager denied a 5 week PTO request after they just got back from a vacation 
Nepotism is your friend 
Low competitive compensation Abysmal management from the middle up The worst HR team you 'll ever work with Riot is struggling to find it place 
no bonus structure , which is beyond odd , especially for a company in the game industry 
Because we have to pay a bunch of admin people making competitive market analysis , dealing with the red tape , only to end on obvious industry standard again 
Apparently bonus are `` already baked into your salary '' but I wa still severely underpaid and found it very challenging to negotiate for a raise beyond the normal 2 % per year 
-Contractors get treated like crap 
Questionable compensation for junior employee 
Until i got a promotion or two I wa pretty disgusted with my compensation 
Stagnant compensation If you join up you 'd better darn well negotiate like a bos , because you 're getting stuck with that salary for the long haul 
Sure , passion is our primary motivation , but passion only stretch so far when you never get cost of living adjustment or bonus to prop up dead wage and the office is located in Santa Monica , one of the most expensive area to live in So 
slightly offset by higher pay rate , but given how ridiculously expensive LA is , wage would need to be much much higher to fully offset the cost 
In some category the company also underpays compared to others 
The mitigating factor here are the perk like free lunch and open PTO 
Only a select few spoiled people with huge ego get clout or respect for their achievement 
Riot swag and gift are often tailored for male , making them useless for woman 
Salary is not great considering the cost of living in Santa Monica , which is obscene 
Some discipline are paid competitively and others are a joke 
I wa wondering how Riot wa n't just hemorraging money left and right with all the thing they were doing for employee , professional player , business venture , etc 
* Pay is n't great 
Most of that is probably the inherent lower pay that people in the game industry receive , but that should n't be a constraint we accept 
Teams became bloated 
This one 's personal , but unlimited PTO actually made it feel pretty bad taking time off 
Sometimes people complain about `` mandatory event '' , but even our mandatory event have always been optional and usually come with a cool reward 
For example , after our last `` mandatory '' event , we got to see The Dark Knight Rises a day before general release for free 
Compensation is n't market competitive unless you 're a super star artist or engineer 
Lack of a widespread bonus plan 
Lower wage than a similar position at other company 
To make matter worse you have rude and incompetent people being rewarded and allowed to fail repeatedly while other team have to re-explain the reasoning behind project over and over after a proven record of success 
This will pay you way more dividend than competence or aptitude 
Accountability is a big issue at the company , recognition for hard work go unnoticed and the wrong people end up getting scapegoated because of this illusion 
Stagnant compensation If you join up you 'd better darn well negotiate like a bos , because you 're getting stuck with that salary for the long haul 
Sure , passion is our primary motivation , but passion only stretch so far when you never get cost of living adjustment or bonus to prop up dead wage and the office is located in Santa Monica , one of the most expensive area to live in So 
On top of that , there is no bonus structure similar to many other game company 
It 's a sad fact that people doing similar job in different part of the organization get paid different amount and many of the people brought in over the past year are paid more than the rest of u and are n't bringing any more value 
Pay wa pretty low consistently 
Took 4 year to get my pay in line with industry standard 
Generally low pay a gaming industry , company struggling in structure , poor mentorship in general 
Would benefit from le project and more focus 
[ + ] Compensation : Despite our obvious and enormous financial success , the majority of employee , new employee especially , are not sharing in the LoL bonanza 
As far a I 'm aware , there are no bonus , profit-sharing , or additional option being granted 
Riot can get away with paying slightly-above average salary for it very young staff who are just happy to work on an amazing game at an amazing company , but a it workforce matures , they will need to create a path for them to pay for their kid ' college tuition and secure their retirement 
But I feel we do not have anywhere near the same respect for , or expend a much effort or creativity to keep and reward , the people we already have 
Along those line , a number of the company 's smaller `` perk '' disguise their desire to have you live , eat and breathe Riot all the time 
They offer subsidized dinner when you work late ( which is often ) , plan vacation and trip to the movie a part of company outing , and otherwise monopolize a much time a possible 
We support a live service that run 24/7 and never stop , sometimes you will work a lot , but the company offer mandatory vacation time and even pay an yearly retreat to everyone 
They also like doing all these cutesy thing like bringing in food and treat 
Questionable compensation for junior employee 
Until i got a promotion or two I wa pretty disgusted with my compensation 
Not so healthy but with an onsite gym you cant complain 
Sometimes people complain about `` mandatory event '' , but even our mandatory event have always been optional and usually come with a cool reward 
For example , after our last `` mandatory '' event , we got to see The Dark Knight Rises a day before general release for free 
long hour -pay is n't where it can be -the usual office politics can be annoying and difficult to deal with 
Rioters can be entitled and lack commercial sense 
Employees are not treated equally 
Compensation is lacking , a Dublin is super expensive 
For SWEs , a lot of people complain that the comp is n't comparable to FAANG 
However , the compensation is still better than your medium sized tech company 
It 'll make you very happy , you should get paid well , and the game team are legitimate 
Comp is not comparable to other tech company , even though it 's high compared to other game company 
Sexism unfortunately still happens within the community Really hard to ask for a raise 
Their compensation is effectively stuck outside of their 3 % annual raise until they can get to the next band or PX+ 
Riot ha some way around this ( cash & stay bonus , etc 
Training for non-red-badge employee is basically non-existent , whole subclass of full time employee without full time benefit listed a `` contractor '' , likely to be paid under market rate , many hire completely unqualified and `` learn on the job '' how to do their work , team leader often unknowledgeable about standard practice and knowledge of their position and unqualified to instruct employee how to do their work , unqualified leader and employee protected by nepotism 
There will also probably be an exodus of talent next March when the final big bonus payment drop 
We support a live service that run 24/7 and never stop , sometimes you will work a lot , but the company offer mandatory vacation time and even pay an yearly retreat to everyone 
Nepotism is your friend 
Because we have to pay a bunch of admin people making competitive market analysis , dealing with the red tape , only to end on obvious industry standard again 
Compensation is good for game industry but not quite a high a big tech company 
Bad management , silo team with overlapping responsibility , one of the worst compensation system a such a sizable company , inexperienced and bro mgmt team ( D20 ) 
For example , there 's no real guide to when you can use your `` unlimited '' PTO , and asking lead to a sort of cryptic `` I do n't know , do YOU think you should go on PTO ? '' attitude from management 
Variable compensation structure is comically inadequate for all but the most sr 
Not so healthy but with an onsite gym you cant complain 
Salary is not great considering the cost of living in Santa Monica , which is obscene 
Communication issue across the company because they 're growing at a pace they ca n't keep up with -Hard work is valued but rarely rewarded -Very poor compensation compared to the rest of the industry 
They expect to hire the top talent in the industry but do n't pay employee enough to live decent life in one of the most expensive place to live 
-Little perk available and only applicable to particular employee demographic -Poor time-off/holiday plan -Lack of 401k , performance bonus , and profit sharing -Extreme lack of employee mentoring and growth opportunity -Broken system lead to consant short term fix 
Pay wa pretty low consistently 
Took 4 year to get my pay in line with industry standard 
2018 is not Riot 's year : This is going to be a year where Riot is building it innovative project , not the year when ton of new game are launched and glory/bonuses/launch party are being celebrated 
They deserve to feel the satisfaction of a hard day 's work and pay they 've truly earned by contributing value somewhere 
Entitlement and complacency is growing
