Undergoing a disruptive reorganization,"Jan 27, 2022 - Manager",1,"Friendly and talented coworkers are fun and easy to work with. I haven't encountered a single angry/difficult person, which is different from most prior employment of mine. The company (as an entity) seems to care about employee well-being.","The reorganization currently happening on the publishing side is an unmitigated disaster. Perhaps unbeknownst to them, Ubi-lifers (20+ yrs with the company), Senior VPs, and others close to the top have pushed many FTEs on the publishing side into a ~ 9-month period of ambiguity. Their political bickering about who gets what team, why, where those teams will sit, etc. is unprofessional and seriously impacting morale and productivity.",2 people found this review helpful

You can work your butt off to get a higher position for very little pay off in terms of pay raises. Most of the higher positions up from a basic support agent have more responsibility but very little increased pay.

Agents support each other* and leads will always listen without judgement when you need to vent. Support work is rewarding and you have the chance to help unhappy people have fun again. It can be an opportunity to have a fleeting positive moment with someone who might not have another that day. There are vital skills and strategies that can be picked up and refined on the job, especially for anyone who does not have retail and/or food service experience and has no desire to work in those industries.

When you want to feel human again, you can leave.","You aren't a person, you're not a support robot, you're barely even a number. What you are is your contribution to whether a bunch a bunch of numbers line up with projections. You will be told that you should put the needs of the players first and foremost and then you will be paid less and informed you are leaving money on the table if you do not rush through the work, pushing as much of it off on your coworkers as possible. You will be rushed through training and seldom to never receive any further training. You will be expected to know how to do everything very quickly. You will watch in horror as departments are outsourced to undertrained workers and your clients suffer. You will bear the brunt of these frustrations with next to nothing to show for it while working for one of the most profitable companies on the planet.

Management constantly asks how they can be better, but completely ignores suggestions from employees. Management plays favorites and only provides career advancement to those who are willing to play their games. 90% if not more of this job is copy - pasting responses over and over until the players are left with no choice but to chat their support chat. Management gets upset when you spend more than 5 minutes with a player explaining to them why our games are so broken, and that they just need to ""wait"" until we can resolve their issue. The permanent employee's are lazy, and refuse to perform their jobs correctly. Instead they will push cases and chats to the temporary agents to perform instead.

No one want to even do overtime when it is offered. Pay is very low compared to industry for work and the. If you can make a decent wage somewhere else, I highly recommend to not apply because you will regret quitting your job for this. You will start getting weekly harassing emails from your manager telling how bad you are doing even though you have never received training that shows you how to handle those type issues. Monthly you will discussions your failures and how to improve and you will get written up. You will mostly likely get let go in few months. I have seen thousands of people come and go, some were fired and most left before they get fired. I loved working for this company when started, however things are getting worst after every upper management meeting and the only one affected are the ones at the bottom. Believe me when I say this, you will regret quitting your full time for this job.

I got robbed twice working at Ubisoft (like literally),"Jul 28, 2018 - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",1,"-The experience of working on a major title, many people don't get that. My work, and the work on the title was an incredibly rewarding experience.","- My computer was stolen from the ubisoft building from my desk, a hobo off the street somehow came in and stole it. My work PC mind you. I lost 1-month worth of work. - I was robbed the second time when the fire exit door was remarkably left open, allowing more hobos to come in and steal my personal belongings this time. I wasn't the only one robbed in the building. The second time it also seemed like they didn't use insurance to cover the cost because then the insurance rate would go up, and I was told to suck it up. - Management was horrifying about the ordeal, claiming it was my fault my stuff got stolen the second time because a companywide e-mail was sent telling people not to have their personal items at work. So, you can't customize your desk on the fear of being robbed. Seriously, this is a multi-billion-dollar company that can't afford security. - My lead didn't know the direction we wanted to go. Using vague terminology to describe what he wanted in Wikipedia, then yelling at team for not going the direction he thought he wanted to go. - My leads and upper management wanted me to fail by not revealing to me issues they had with me and my work until the project was over. Unwilling to resolve issues amicably. - Producers had less experience in the industry than the development team. This let to many issues when producers would offer solutions that were bad ideas, but demand they be put in anyways, then removed when they didn't work, wasting time and resources from the devs. -Producers managed time but lied about the time we had to finish our part of the game. There are parts of the game untouched by our department because it was never scheduled. And yet my lead had the audacity to blame me for not finishing, left my head scratching. - Wasted food. We would get free food in the cafeteria, but management kept buying food no one wanted, resulting in a lot of food no one would touch. I can't believe I'm saying this, but the company had an unhealthy obsession with buying skim milk for everyone. There would be 1-2 jugs of skim milk that would go untouched rotten by the end of each weak, the fridge would be over-crowded with jugs of different types of milk. Meanwhile, when I requested one of the jugs be whole milk because the skim-milk goes wasted, I sent them a picture of the wasted milk, just so they'd believe me. I got written up for it because that insinuated the person ordering food is wasting food, and I hurt her feelings, apparently by sending the proof via pic. Can't believe that happened. - Instead of hiring a maid to clean dirty dishes, management would often throw away dirty dishes, cups, and silverware, rather than clean them. This happened more than once during production - Mandatory morning meetings wasting 2 + hours of work, providing little to no use to the majority who attend. They expect you to make up the time we missed in OT. - When they tell you to come to OT you better come, otherwise you'll be gone before you know it. - I got harassed by a disgruntled employee because he didn't like the way I worked on his stuff, even though I was asked by management to work on it. -Some leads JUST DON'T COMMUNICATE with their teams. Like, am I supposed to be working on this? Who is supposed to be working on this? It was never communicated, sometimes resulting in two team members having worked on the same thing. -Despite the many women and LGBT crowd at the company, I got picked on for being gay. In fact, one person calling me names, was a lesbian just trying to fit in with the guys. - One time I found spit in my coffee cup. I told my lead about it and he told me it was no big deal and to ignore it.",31 people found this review helpful
Sub Standard Quality Standard and Unstable work environment.,"Jun 15, 2018 - Player Support in Raleigh, NC",2,-Free Games -Networking Opportunities -Working next to like minded geeks,"-Customer service department is under funded and it shows. Training is almost irrelevant to what you will actually be doing. The customer service department only cares about hitting numbers. Bare minimum quality, Any time an opportunity arose to go above and beyond for the customer, they just refused. Everything is done through text macros and there is almost zero time to add a personal touch. -Because of unrealistic metrics, no one takes the time to figure out real solutions. What almost EVERYONE does, is just throw some sort of generic troubleshooting steps at the customer and since agents don't have to take ownership of their support tickets, the mess is just pushed off to next agent. Example: Customer Comes in for game crash. Then First agent sends general troubleshooting steps. The customer doesn't read it because the emails are wall of poorly written instructions. Catered to someone with an experienced technical background, but definitely not towards the 16 year old just wanting to play their game. Then next agent, reads a few words of the reply and decides which other generic troubleshooting steps they want to send the customer. This goes on until the customer gives up actually trying to get help, or one of the over worked ""experienced agents"" takes the time to actually fix the issue. -All full time employees are jaded and burnt out -Customer base is pretty toxic. Lots of toxic players play Rainbow six seige -Customer service department is told they a loss mitigation and that they have no value. They are seen as a liability, caused by NDA leaks, which would be prevented if they actually cared about bringing quality people into the workplace. I didn't even get an in person interview. -There is about a 80% chance they are going to let you go after the buzz of their new game is gone and , if you are lucky next time they release a game. They may call you back just to under pay you and over work you again. And maybe after they do they to you a few times, they MIGHT hire you on directly instead of through a staffing agency. -Career minded customer service agents are squeezed out. There is alarming amount of resistances to listening to constructive feedback. They just wan't button pressers, not intelligent career minded individuals.",2 people found this review helpful

I was being paid about 20% less than I should have been. The appeal of working ""in the industry"" as a gamer might be enough to make that a wash for many, but not fair when you also consider the stresses that come up that.

It's all about the company name,"Sep 11, 2016 -",2,"- Vacation and sick time off are based off of European ways, so basically, you will never run out of sick or vacation days ever again - The Digital Marketing and PR teams are probably the only teams I would recommend to anyone, and probably Brand Management. DM has their stuff together and are well rounded and do solid work. They also seem to genuinely like one another. The PR team, while they don't have a lot of power or sway at Ubisoft (at least compared to other PR teams I've worked with at other gaming companies) have GREAT leaders who want to grow their team--they care about mentoring and doing a good job. Brand is chaotic but they hold most of the power, so I would recommend it as a good starting point for someone looking to go into Brand/Marketing. - If you're looking to get your foot in the door at a game company in an entry level role, Ubisoft is a good place to start. Get your name on some AAA titles then reevaluate once you hit the 2 year mark. - You get a lot of free swag and get to go to some cool parties (they are a French company so the booze is often prime)","- Everything is cookie cutter--little innovation or interest in trying new things. Ubisoft is very much a ""follower"" company, not a ""leader"" company. - The company needs some serious pruning. It's amazing how unprofessional some of the Managers are (how they communicate and interact with others) which is probably because they aren't actually adults (ie. mature enough to not breed drama and negativity). The people at the company are generally awesome, but the handful of toxic people there just ruin it. - Pay is mediocre. You get free swag and get to go to some cool company parties (the company literally throws money around so people who don't need to be at certain events can go), so you really give away a good amount of what you could be making for these luxuries. So it really depends on what you want. For a year or two, these novelties are great, but it wears off pretty quickly. - Promotions seem to get handed out randomly. A LOT of people who do great work seem to get stuck in some sort of undertow and end up frustrated. They leave only to get a better job that's the equivalent of 1 or 2 promotions with a nice salary increase. It's easy to get stuck at Ubisoft if you're one of these people, and Ubisoft seems to feel that it's easier that these potential star-employees just leave than take a look at issues running deeper within the company. One friend of mine was actually told by her VP that due to the high turnover of her bosses they couldn't evaluate her properly, that this wasn't anyone's fault but unfortunately, they needed to review her again. She left for a way better opportunity. Basically, if you feel you can do bigger, greater things and need more challenges, Ubisoft probably won't give you that, so look elsewhere. - It's rare for contractors to get hired on full time and many of the contractors that I knew felt like outsiders - For larger gaming companies, it's not unusual for the majority of employees to have zero knowledge of games. The same is true for Ubisoft. The Sales, Digital Marketing, PR, pretty much every team except for maybe Community and the Sales Analysts are at all versed in games, or show any respect for games as anything more than a sales number. It's so bad that a game room was made to help provide access to games to help encourage more people to play, but only actual gamers use it. The Recruitment efforts haven't changed so more and more people who don't know games nor care about games are hired.",11 people found this review helpful

The company doesn't pay well, but the stability of the company is a good counter to that. However, Ubisoft isn't the greatest when it comes to promoting their employees. Talented, hard-working. people will deliver consistently great work and they still have to prove themselves to get a promotion. You'll hear reasons for being rejected for a promotion like, ""You're too hard core to work on this more casual title."" Seriously? Ubisoft's habit of doing this means that many employees leave for other companies to prove themselves and then return to Ubisoft; meaning that it's a great training ground but if you want to work in a position your skill set is best suited for then you'll likely have to leave to achieve it. It's a shame that they don't seem see the value in their talent, but other companies most definitely will, and they'll pay better to boot. During my personal time at Ubisoft i was rejected for a promotion more than once. I left and I'm doing the same exact job that I was turned down for at Ubisoft, and I'm willing to bet dollars to doughnuts that I make more where I am now then I would have doing the same thing at Ubisoft.",9 people found this review helpful

Fantastic community & workplace,"Sep 28, 2014 - Anonymous Employee",4,"People here are really your friends. I didn't meet anyone who wasn't willing to share their work, stories, or even jokes in the middle of a work day. Really pleasant place to work. That kind of environment makes you want to come back every day and not want to go home every now and then. Even if you don't speak French. Note that my experience may only apply to my particular project and it may not be the same case to all other projects. In particular, the organization and management of the project I worked on was ordely and flexible. I did find that at times, it seemed like management was constantly making massive changes to the project in question that were definitely way too early to make assumptions on. I also found that at times, it seemed like there was no clear direction, but when it came down to crunch everything was spot on and it became immediately clear what had to be done. The company offers tons of training courses, both online and in person. Free English or French classes during the Winter and Summer. Great personal gym and tons of medical/health consultation right in the Montreal Peck space. There was also tons of after work events. Plenty of beer and barbecues to attend, water rafting, or amusement park stuff to go to. Definitely always improving.","Regarding promotions and time-off policies, there is some weirdness there. I never understood how time-off worked. You could ""dock"" hours, but it never seemed like there was any official way to ""dock"" hours so you kind of just were responsible for being honest. Which is nice, but is questionable. I noted that there wasn't a whole lot of leg room regarding what your pay was and how you can stand out to get a promotion besides just becoming lead for a team. Sometimes management, again at least on my team, became unresponsive and we fell behind more than once. The PR department I feel is definitely lacking. The company is rediculously secretive apparently due to investors. Yet, everything gets leaked. New projects are constantly getting announced ahead of schedule unintentionally. Also, the PR fiasco with women as main characters was handled utterly poorly. Also Uplay does a lot of fantastic things for us developers, but Ubisoft makes no effort to explain that to consumers. They only see it as DRM, and it really isn't. There is way more to Uplay that makes it great, but Ubisoft itself doesn't acknowledge it. They don't address these kinds of issues for some reason dead on.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Phenomenal place to grow and create,"Feb 23, 2013 - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",4,"Exceptional autonomy to grow and drive the business as you see fit. I think what a lot of the people leaving negative comments about the company don't realize is compared to other big multinational companies, there is significantly less politics than they think, at least in North America. The culture is entrepreneurial which makes for interesting and engaging work. Nothing is really out of bounds so long as it makes sense/has a good payout. Management is highly protective of its workers and go to great lengths, even if it isn't immediately clear to the average worker, to protect their jobs. To me the culture is a nice balance between big company structure and small company freedom. Compensation, if you can make it past the first year or two and prove yourself, improves dramatically. The people are really a lot of fun and good to work with. Those that are not are usually not there long.","I don't disagree with some of the other comments listed. Upperward growth past a ""director"" level on the commercial side is difficult as there is just nowhere to go. Senior team members rarely move out of the company. While the 'shoot from the hip' style is mostly fun, there is a lot of room for improvement around the discipline of the business. Several top managers have grown from inside the organization and so have no understanding of different business techniques or strategies beyond what they themselves have implemented. Further, some mid to top level managers struggle with managing people and have had neither the necessary training nor the role modeling they need to be truly effective leaders. Training is not a part of the culture, as another reviewer pointed out and this clearly needs to be addressed as an necessity to retain top talent. All that said, guess what, every company has a litany of issues it needs to address. Ubi is no exception. Despite these issues, it is a phenomenal place and industry to work in with more upside than down. Grain of salt for the disgruntled reviewers who have left and want to leave a swath of destruction behind them.",3 people found this review helpful

The upper management in North America does their best to foster good company culture and new ideas despite what seems like a frustrating lack of room to grow for those upper executives.","There is some tension between North American and EMEA operations.

Some teams and individuals are the best in the whole industry, and I can only praise them. I can recommend Ubisoft as an employer to everyone, but not a specific studio (see cons).","Unfortunately, you will also encounter the most toxic and incompetent people in the whole industry, from junior to director level. Especially in Ubisoft Abu Dhabi, you will find a bullying culture in the development team that management personally created and fosters to oppress opinion and development of their employees just to get their personal opinion across. This goes ofc. directly against the studio's own values, which is terrible. There are many stories about people having panic attacks or getting depressed and resigning, after getting bullied by management on the development team, because they dare to have their own opinions. The studio lost almost all its leads within a year (Design, QA, Brand, Operations, Community, Support, QA, Programming, etc.), while the people left in management have little to no understanding how to develop and publish a good game. What is developed, because of this culture, is poor and often times delayed. There are amazing people who work in this studio, but they are pushed down and held back. They all should leave as soon as they can to find a place where they can be themselves and grow. Other Ubisoft studios are much, much better, though! Downsides also are a bloated corporate structure and many people with too many opinions, but rarely anyone who will take the lead and make decisions.",3 people found this review helpful

Negotiate your package really well when you start because once you're in the job, it's close to impossible to get promotions or yearly salary increase above 5%. Moving internally is not that easy.

It's just decided by HR and you get what you're given. - Only around 10% of people outside of the studio speak english, maybe less. This is doubly for businesses.

"The video game industry is the most dynamic and exciting sector of the entertainment industry, but...","Apr 28, 2009 - Senior Brand Manager in San Francisco, CA",4,Ubisoft maintains its small company roots despite being the 3rd largest third-party publisher in the world. The people are real and the culture is phenomenal for those who either do not care for a corporate atmosphere or are looking to retreat from a corporate atmosphere. Working in the fastest growth sector of the entertainment industry is exciting and dynamic. And being part of the maturation process of an otherwise unsophisticated and still-maturing industry (and company) provides a TREMENDOUS learning opportunity.,"Being French-owned with its HQ in Paris, the cultural differences adds a complexity to the workplace regardless of what function you are in. The French are known for their bureaucracy and Ubisoft is no different. However, the US subsidiary maintains enough independence to dilute this redtape so one is not completely flustered and frustrated. The 9 hour time difference also makes it challenging to maintain a completely ""open-communication/voice-to-voice"" environment.",5 people found this review helpful

"Ubisoft, an awesome place to work","Jun 11, 2008 - in San Francisco, CA",5,The diversity of the people who work there and the fact that I'm actually working in the video game industry is very cool. Management is very forward thinking and I always feel like the company is moving in a positive direction. They strive to be an Employer of Choice by asking the employees what they are happy and unhappy with and then addressing those things. The environment is casual so jeans are fine to wear every day. We have something called Good Times...money is allocated for each department each quarter to be used to go offsite for a day and do something fun as a team.,"Nothing, I love it all.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Probably after a few years you will get stuck with a similar salary to the one you accepted in the initial offer. - Not many learning opportunities (no courses, workshops, master classes, languages, etcetera) - If you're an ambitious individual, forget about climbing the corporate ladder if you aren't French (or French Canadian, tops). If you're really lucky you could get to be lead, but it is very probable that you will get to be a senior after 3 years and that's it (exactly 3, as performance doesn't really count in promotions, only time) - For now, it's only co-dev.

We were once all outraged by it but the want for it to become a movement instead of a solution made me want to leave. I want to work at a Games studio, not a hash tag.",1 person found this review helpful

Like a family ... an abusive family,"Aug 6, 2021 - Senior Programmer in Düsseldorf",1,- Technical exposure - Industry experience - Interaction with international teams - You get your name in credits,"It's a common joke that Ubisoft Blue Byte pays poorly. Everybody knows it. You'll hear about it in your first month from people that have worked there for 5/10 years. But they'll tell you it's okay because ""everyone is like a family"". They'll point out that other game publishers have massive overtime/crunch issues and at least the company has work/life balance. When the low pay gets raised by people anonymously during staff meetings, management always looks surprised and mumble the same excuses. But here's the thing: just because you don't expect unpaid overtime from people regularly and just because you don't have toxic working conditions doesn't mean you can exploit people. It's especially sad to see young talented people get recruited from poorer countries in Asia/South America/Eastern Europe only for them to realize with a shock a few months in they're being paid poorly and rent/quality of life is difficult. But by then, of course, their visa is tied to working with the company, they're in a foreign country and they don't have a support structure. So what do they do? They stay. HR and Recruitment know this. They know there's a constant supply of idealistic young people who look starry-eyed at UBISOFT and will send in their CVs. So they don't care about keeping people, they don't care that they give you less leave days than most German companies, they don't care that they pay 40-50% less than the market. Any complaints about pay or conditions is always blamed on ""head office"" or ""Paris"", and you're discouraged from raising the issue publicly. I wish I could say that besides the terrible pay and a defensive HR department things are great, but it's not. Priorities get dictated from French upper management who veto at will. Co-dev studios dictate all the terms of engagement, even if they create toxic environments and borderline sexual harassment. HR will not have your back, because they don't want to upset upper management. The internal training platform ULearn is a joke, and internal benefits get dropped or changed at the whim of whoever has a budget they have to make work that year. It's a pity, because most of the studio management are genuinely kind. But it doesn't change the objective situation on the ground: it's exploitative and people are being gaslit instead of the problems being addressed. Unless you have a hard requirement to work in the gaming industry and you have no other options, don't come work here.",9 people found this review helpful

Depression is daily,"Jul 13, 2021 - Anonymous Employee in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi",1,Free beer every Thursday Some colleagues are pretty decent,"Pay is NEVER going to be what it should be. Do not expect a high wage here. Juniors are making 5000 - 7000 AED a month and living out of shared accomodations in bunk beds. Intermediates are not doing much better. Your pay will scale to your race. Project manager is verbally abusive to employees under him, having brought people to tears. Treats employees like slaves, with a clear hierarchy that ends and starts with him. There are no other high-level employees anymore, with most of them having quit or were forced out for having a differing opinion OT is daily. Expect to be there until 8am the next day on public holidays. Completely unpaid. This last months, while they treat you like it's your fault as the game is failing. Game is dead. Project management is bleeding the money dry while lying to employees about the stats to keep up appearances while they can. Studio has only two games, with no successes. One game is inherited and is on a steep decline, with the other being cringely unacknowledged by headquarters. Studio Director has never come out of his office and socialised once with staff. The general feeling amongst employees was that he blames us for the failures of the game. Has directly come out and used analogies that are demeaning and abusive for why we are treated the way we are. HR will never defend. Any employee that speaks up is, and have been fired. This has been 6 employees this year with over 20 people having quit in the past three. The studio is close to being closed. Any leaving employees are being replaced with people who cost less with lower titles. Expenses are being cut left right and center. Please don't consider this place. The reasons will all be apparent if the project somehow survives beyond your probation. Do not expect them to take care of you, they regularly break the law in regards to employees.",11 people found this review helpful

"Supportive Management, Talented Team, Exotic Location, Awesome Benefits","May 22, 2021 - Senior Game Designer in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi",4,"To me, Ubisoft Abu Dhabi was and will always be the prefect place to be for any game devs who enjoy working in a company with an absolute supportive culture, a constant readiness for challenges and an on-going self-improving atmosphere. Honestly I left only because of family reasons. The team I had been working with was also rock-solid, professional, with a deep understanding of the free to play model, and was always passionate and always evolving. The management team had always been there for us, providing constant insights, professional helps, and was genuinely caring for people. Salary had always been competitive plus tons of additional benefits, making you carefree to enjoy both life and work.","If you are really not so into sunny weather, free beaches, azure coastlines, cheap luxurious cars, exotic delicacies, and most of all, a bunch of passionate professionals with a super supportive studio management, then don't consider going working there.",1 person found this review helpful

You can do better; you deserve better,"Jun 14, 2021 - Game Designer in Bucharest, Bucuresti",1,"- A lot to learn as a game designer; but not so many people to learn from. - The best thing that happened to me was when the project finally ended and I moved to a different project. - Some ice-cream during summer, some cakes for christmas... and that's it? Ah, free T-shirts with the project. Yey. - Some teambuildings. - Some people were very fun and nice to work with, and made it worth for a while.","- Almost lowest salary offers in the country (for game industry) - Poor management (a lot of big egos, big names, big titles; but little experience in actual team management) - Leads and directors come up with a lot and sudden design changes on the go resulting into overtime for the designers, programmers (god bless their soul), artists and testers. This isn't how you ""iterate"" on design. - Despicable career progression. They basically don't take into count any previous years of experience. ""You already have 2 years of experience? Great, you start from 0 again; see you in 2-3 years for a promotion"" Promotion is done only after performance review (which is yearly), and you might be lucky* enough to be promised the promotion 6 months earlier, and then actually not get promoted for no good reason. (political stuff, too many people in the same seniority, etc.) Moreover, if you don't join the meme club and do some fake flattery, your chances of promotion (and well-being) are significantly diminished. - Raises are offered just to even the score with the other people on the same positions and seniority (I was shocked to find this out). - If you're good at what you do (i.e. finish tasks earlier, good performance) you'll be handled random tasks from others and be milked of life. - Overtime usually occurs for 15-30h/month once every 2-3 months when important milestones need it. - No benefits what-so-ever, besides the library of Ubisoft Games, promised online library (that didn't work, especially during quarantine).",2 people found this review helpful

Please consider carefully before joining,"Jan 25, 2021 - Game Developer in Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi",1,Opportunity to learn new things. Opportunity to grow if you can play politics and make right connections.,"Highly toxic work environment where employees are bullied and disrespected by the production management. All complaints to HR will be ignored as they view employees as disposable. Extremely poor planning. There is no effort to plan as they know they can make employees work overtime. The company demands 100% loyalty. If you start to question the overtime or the unfair practices, they seen you as enemy. The company has a “if you have a problem, you can leave” mindset knowing that not everyone can leave suddenly specially during covid times. So none of complaints will be heard as they are seen as your problems. You will be made to work till dried up and burned out. No work life balance. You are expected to do 15 hour shifts, weekend work and anything else that is needed for project delivery. The overtime is seen as the mistake of the employees even though there was poor project planning. Leaves will only approve when it is convenient to company. When you complaint about overtime and other unfair practices, they will say this is how gaming industry is. You cannot communicate ideas as every decision related to design, art, programming and everything else is supervised by production manager. None of your ideas or your experience matter.",9 people found this review helpful

You can stay late and play your favorite games. (Provided that you have allotted a good workstation) Free breakfast. (Which is average at best) You get all of the Ubisoft games free on PC. (Well, that's the least you can expect right?) Most of the colleagues and seniors are good and friendly. You can learn a lot if you don't treat it as a casual job and pay attention. You can take smoke breaks anytime if you are friendly enough with your lead. Once a year, you get a chance to buy Ubisoft shares, and with that come good benefits. You get free chocolate and fruits on Tuesday and Thursday respectively. Once a year, you get a so-called E3 party in which you can have ""French"" food. Once a year, you can have as much cheap alcohol and food as you want (Conditions apply) at the annual party. You can have a couple of years' worth of experience here and then move to a better company. You will have fewer issues finding a job at another company as Ubisoft's reputation is surprisingly good in the market.","Pay, pay, pay. One of the worst paying AAA gaming company to QC/QA The annual bonus is included in your CTC so that they don't have to pay you extra. Food you get at the studio is cheap although absolutely horrendous. They offer insurance to the employees but it is only limited to you, your spouse and your kids, No option to include your parents. Pay is less. HR is non-existent. Or maybe they just don't care. They are full of crap and constantly give false promises or straight-up lies.

(2 years at junior, 4 at intermediate, 5-6 at senior Bloated dev teams that arent open to hearing ideas for a game's direction. Most major decisions are dictated by the HQ studio. You end up feeling like a cog in a machine and eventually lose interest in the product. Creativity takes a backseat to ways to get more and more money out of the player after the sale of the product. In the past youd have a creative director but now you have a committee of finiancial and engagement members that have tunnel vision on specific metrics and it makes the product much worse as a whole. modern ubisoft games introduce a lot of addictive gambling elements aimed at kids.my morals dont align with that Very Low salaries. Glass ceiling in the company if youre not a french speaker or national. A lot of french conversations on the floor even though it's supposed to be an English speaking company. Groups seem to form based on this and it factors in during performance reviews if youre very close to the french group Project bonsues are tiny. On a game released in Ubisoft' most profitable year ever, selling over 10 million units. The bonus was less than a month's (already slow) salary for a 4 year project",13 people found this review helpful

Great worklife balance. Good studio location. Ubisoft is a very safe company to work for in terms of job security. Yves Guillemot truly showed how an amazing leader he is during the Corona times, with cheerful and reassuring email to all studios. My lead where one of the most amazing people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and working with, she cared so much for her team, which became even more prevalent during working from home because of the Corona virus. She would ask if I needed anything and made sure that I where doing well. I can't thank her enough for the support she gave me during that time. I really wished that I could have stayed at Ubisoft Bucharest, the people are amazing and studio the same, but the salary just isn't enough to make a living.","Very low salary and other compensation, with very little way of getting pay increase. Romania is not very suited towards expats, there is a lot of paper work that you must do in person, that is only in Romanian, Ubisoft does try to help, but it's Incredibly daunting. The Romanian to expat ratio at Ubisoft Bucharest is very low and many expats are leaving as of 2020, with very few new ones joining it seems.

Job Security vs Uncompetitive Salary,"May 1, 2020 - Software Engineer in Montreal, QC",3,"-Ubisoft is so big, it is relatively easy to move around and meet a ton of people. Every production and franchise are like their own little separate studios, for better or worse. This makes job security very safe! Ubi generally doesn't let people go unless you give them a reason. -Very transparent about production's internally. Also internal testing and feedback allows you to contribute to other franchises and projects you don't even work on. It makes you feel included in the company and it's products, establishes a bit of trust. Many other game dev studios do not have this level of transparency. -Studio itself is lovely, is in a nice area, and people are (generally) super nice even if you're not French. Can't speak French? Haven't had any problem with anyone over the years. -Summer and holiday parties are pretty epic. -Depends on the production, but sick days and vacation are super flexible and hardly ever questioned. Every manager I've had has been more than supportive and willing to give people breaks or work from home if your position allows it. You do not get a lot of days off every year, but that's offset by the fact you have unlimited sick days and most productions let you use 'sick days' instead of vacation ones if you have emergencies or obligations like family matters or problems at home to take care of. Office/work hours are typically extremely flexible too but managers vary on their rules. -Ubi does a lot for it's community both locally and game dev at large. They host tons of events and programs for kids in school who aspire to be game devs for example. -Some feel Ubisoft is not diverse enough, especially with gender specifically, but honestly I've found it to be one of the most diverse and openly welcoming workplaces so far. There's always room for improvement so I hope they continue. But, Ubi does not shy away from these topics.","-Ubisoft knows they treat their employees with job security better than other companies. So the trade off is salary. Their salary is uncompetitive for every role and focus - art, programming, testing, you name it. It sometimes feels insulting when you hear about your friends in other game studios making double your and your fellow coworkers numbers every year. Bonuses are slim too, especially if your project did not ship that year. They have rules for live service game bonuses post launch, but it's all super competitive and unrealistic expectations so the payouts are abysmal. The studio constantly bleeds top tier talent because of this. -Besides the summer and winter parties, perks at Ubisoft are slim. You only get 2 free games a year. Insurance is only okay and doesn't cover a lot. Coffee is not free and very expensive in the office so you have to make your own, I've never seen this in any other work office yet alone a game dev one. The ""food"" cafeteria inside is small, expensive, and frozen reheated stuff that people have gotten sick from. Once a month, they give out free bagels. If you can get one, you have to come into the office early and compete with coworkers before they run out. They sometimes offer fruit as well, but it's the same situation: 5 bananas for 40+ people. Makes no sense and management doesn't acknowledge it. Surprisingly a lot of people at Ubi think the perks are great and suck up about it, but they're also the same people who come from no experience or poor ones and haven't been exposed to the completion Ubi has. -In general, the games are getting stale and the market is rejecting Ubisoft. They're struggling to compete year after year, and it's one golden goose out of 5-6 that ""saves"" the company and keeps it moving without firing enmass. One of these days, it won't cut it. Upper management is out of touch and are using antiquated methods of copy and paste rather than ingenuity and innovation. Every project has awesome ideas but then the upper management tells them to stop, do it their way or stop working. They've had huge missteps lately and are letting good ideas die.",4 people found this review helpful

You may ask them a question regarding your move, and you won't hear back for 5+ days, and even then your question won't be answered. -Career path, be weary - if you aren't given an idea where you are headed in the interview, chances are you will be stuck in a stagnant job opportunity. This can reflect poorly on your experience for sure. - Bonuses: They allow for you to obtain them, however, sometimes the goals are very hard to achieve. - RRSP matching is up to 20%.. It seems good on paper, but be warned, if you are working here your pay will be lower (unless in the upper senior positions) which makes the want to contribute 20% pretty difficult to live off of especially in Montreal,QC where the taxes are greater than most provinces.",3 people found this review helpful

"A good company, struggling with change","Oct 21, 2019 - Team Lead in Paris",4,"Ubisoft has a lot of good people and the large majority of the top management truly and genuinely cares for them. This result in: - Relatively good salaries (depending on the various studios and departments, but generally good.) - An approach of work/life balance that has improved drastically in the past years. - Much better job stability than in all of the other major publishers in the video game industry. - Excellent perks for employees generally. - Lots of support and resources available internally. Generally, you end up with a good job, lots of opportunities in the first few years of your career, even if you generally have to go after them yourself, and generally working at Ubisoft is quite enjoyable.","The company is in the majority lead by the same people who founded and built it 30+ years ago. It has some good aspects to it, but a lot of executive / C-level managers are slightly out of touch with the industry, and quite reluctant to embrace necessary changes, being too busy defending their established rôle. This results in a change that is very slow to happen, which can be quite frustrating and risky in a super fast-paced industry. Usually, big structural changes require the validation of high-level stakeholders and can take years to actually happen. Lots of projects and initiatives are killed because some people 'are not comfortable' with them, and in some areas of the organization, dissonant voices can quickly result in career stagnation. Ubisoft is a great company for Juniors to start their career, gain a lot of experience and opportunity, but typically struggle to keeps its super talented and promising experts with ~5 years of experience in the company. They get frustrated at the top management and the friction for everything involving change and eventually quit. While the company has evolved positively in its treatment of misconduct and harassment, a plague in the video game industry, there are still many long-time employees that are known harassers, past or present, and are protected in their position. Fidelity is valued to an extreme at Ubisoft, and sometimes trust is misplaced.",5 people found this review helpful

And they make sure to threat you and issue you character certificate for no reasons. 4)They put ""FAKE CLAUSE"" in the offer letter over the email just as a threat. 5) 9 Hrs work policy is awful. Its quite evident from all of their policies that encourage a slave culture.

Perhaps a little too stable: Teams get frustrated working with or around bad employees, but since they are rarely fired good team members quit or when possible, change projects. The result of this is that with the good team members gone, the bad are the most senior remaining members. The remaining are then sometimes promoted to leadership positions due to seniority, which causes the cycle to repeat and escalate. The solution to every problem is always to throw more bodies at it. This is a very poor solution as it does not account for training time and the problems that come with larger team sizes. More bodies often exacerbates the issue. Definitely some nepotism at play when it comes to leadership roles.

Incompetent Leadership begets incompetence.,"Jan 26, 2019 - Developer",2,Job security Good workplace culture Good work life balance Safe country,Leadership and Production management are generally incompetent. More focused on impressing upwards than they are motivating or empowering a team. Anyone with any experience in identifying problems is often stigmatized as negative and not working well with the team which is just leadership speak for shut up and sit down. Leadership is top down order driven less you incur the wrath of management and your career is stalled because they don’t like you. Promotion process is more a popularity contest on who has the best rumor about you. Milestone objectives are a joke to be spun into successes based on vague goalposts. Work gets redone and redone because leadership rarely has any idea on what work actually gets done because they are more interested in PowerPoint presentations than actual technical or production competency. Is it any wonder the turnover for senior developers is so high. Only a handful of devs in the studio who has been here longer than 5 years. The rest can find more fulfilling work elsewhere.,3 people found this review helpful

Met some really nice, welcoming and cool people.","Didn't ""feel"" like a games studio, it felt a little like an office. Pure white desks, pure white walls. If you walked in there you wouldnt know it was a games studio at all. It looks like another sallary-man Japanese office, just without the suits. Compared to other offices in the Ubisoft family which have posters, statues, decorations all relating to their currently and past projects. Ubisoft Osaka had none of that and it was a shame because it kills the passion of the work we did. Pay is a little lower than at other companies and some of the studios have some serious management issues in terms of scheduling. The only other issue which was really apparent is that the pipeline when working with external third parties (Disney. etc.) is really terrible. If you're working on a game for someone not within the Ubisoft immediate family then there really is no active leadership (No director, no Art Director etc.) and its extremely frustrating for developers to have to deliver bi-weekly/ monthly builds to a company and then they bombard you with a ton of feedback all at once.",5 people found this review helpful

Other fitness events (bootcamp, yoga, hockey, etc.) are organized as well. - Dinner provided on nights you stay late. - Depending on project and status, push nights/crunch is kept to a minimum. Some producers and directors deserve to be commended on how they encourage teams to rest instead of crunching. - Mobility, project options, and salary within the studio are good if you've done well in performance reviews. - Job stability here is strong since the studio is still growing and needs strong talent to stay even if/when a project gets cancelled.","- Codev project team sizes tend to balloon, across the entire company and its studios, so you can feel like you're just a number. - Layers and layers of management. Sometimes you can be dissuaded from approaching people in other studios even if you try your best to ensure visibility/tracking of communication yourself. - Sometimes it can feel like you're (re)making the same content on subsequent projects. - Codev leads focusing for major demos can mean you might not be able to work at full capacity or get help unless your stuff is in a demo. - Sometimes documentation for a codev project is awful and threadbare. Not a fault of the Toronto studio, really. - Sometimes you'll be using tools on Project B that consume more time and have worse UX than the tools you used on Project A several years ago. - Proper prototyping isn't usually a focus for many teams on codev projects. Sometimes people sit underutilised. - Cost of living in Toronto is high if you want to own within the city. Rent is similarly high. - Not a lot of parking around the studio.",3 people found this review helpful

A programmer perspective (Reflections studio),"Sep 17, 2016 - Programmer in Newcastle, England",3,Casual Office Environment Flexible Working Hours Nice Building A company social club Job security The ability to move between their international studios,Very low wages. They're aware of this and they struggle to attract and maintain senior developers. As newcastle is seen as a cheap place internationally they drop everybody's wages compared to people doing the same job in another studio. The creative direction of more than 90% of their games is controlled by a few people in france and this results in a lot of games being generic boring open world experiences. In fact many developers including myself won't play the modern ubisoft games being released. Reflections is seen as an outsourcing studio within ubisoft to implement vehicles which can grow tiresome. Bad management and bloated development teams can result in successful and popular releases still being considered a financial failure resulting in no bonuses. Career Progression is extremely slow compared to other companies.There is also a glass ceiling for none-french employees in the company.,5 people found this review helpful

🖐READ BEFORE YOU JOIN (this place destroyed my career in Gaming industry),"Sep 27, 2016 - Junior Game Tester in Pune",1,there are none but you do get a cheap Rs. 5 chocolate every week and a Rs 120 movie ticket every 3 months. if that attracts you more then the cons this company I don't known what to say to you.,"there are many. # no growth # no employee development programs # very less pay less than $200 a month # bullying/politics by management # backstabber friends # people pulling each other's leg to get ahead # unskillful management. almost none of them have a management degree they know you have a passion for games and they will exploit you for that. Beware! here is the story ""I was in QA, working full time for somewhere around $170 a month or so. once I was told to play on two devices at the same time and find bugs and it was also not a request, they even bring that point out in performance review. working overtime without pay is like a compulsion bc if you won't do it they will bring that point out in performance review and you'd not be given any increments/promotion. also the salary increments are like 2% and 3% or maybe you will just get fired. the salary they give is quite low compare to other companies so what they do it keep employees on contracts to not to show it in the records. one of my co-worker was given an IMPOSSIBLE task to test a game in couple of days for FINAL submission (for the final launch) and bc it was an android game he was supposed to check the game on ALL the different kind of android phones (basically it requires a team to do it). obviously there were bugs in the game and he was later trashed by the management. Ubisoft knows gamers/developers come to join them bc of their passion for games and they just exploit them.﻿""",12 people found this review helpful

Political nightmare,"Sep 2, 2016 - in Toronto, ON",1,Multi national company Solid portfolio of games that are selling pretty well Decent benefits and vacation allowance. Unlimited sick days is unique from what I've seen in the city.,"The culture is cliquey - if you're not part of the 'in crowd', your days are not numbered, but you're unlikely to be considered for any kind of promotion. If you're part of the crowd, you'll be promoted and rewarded because you're liked. Often, they spend ages trying to fill a position and then just promote from within - not because someone proved themselves but because it's the easiest and cheapest thing to do. Salaries are low - Ubisoft claims not to be the best payers because you get the top projects in the industry - sure, you get to be a pipeline studio for another studio that actually controls the game. This means you have very little creative input and have to deal with the other studio's politics as well as your own. Definitely a party culture - this is great when you first arrive but as you grow and develop, it becomes tiresome. Ubisoft Toronto is best if you don't have a family! Montreal wants to dictate process and protocol - this is fine but when you disagree and escalate to Paris, they want you to follow what Montreal does. Being heard in Toronto is nearly impossible. Management runs on a fear basis - people are afraid to speak out. It's a highly political and toxic environment - if you try to move things forward, be creative or even propose to do anything that management didn't have in mind (yes that's a guessing game in itself) then you are screwed.",23 people found this review helpful

Communication is crucial and a lot of things were missed because international employees could not understand the discourse - a lot of issues to do with sexism etc. that was met with resistance when brought up with HR. HR's suggested solutions never materialised, ever. - pay was very little - while I understand the company has changed since I worked there as management turned over, at the time I was there it was a battle of egos where the lower echelons of the company were the ones who suffered by losing their jobs or being overworked.

Work with translations in up to 20+ languages per project (really fun for language nerds). The localization team is friendly and close-knit.","Deadline pressure can be very intense right before a game ships-- expect very busy days and significant amounts of overtime for one or two periods a year of 2-3 weeks or more. It's worse for localization because we always had to wait for all the other teams to make their last-minute changes and then handle the translations at the last _second_. A number of female colleagues have told me that there can be noticeable sexism within Ubisoft as a whole (about 17% women employees), although I don't think it is a problem within the localization department (when I was there it was led by women and composed of almost 50% women).

"Just say ""No,"" unless you're brand new to game industry!","Jul 19, 2015 - Senior Narrative Designer in Montreal, QC",2,"* Well, their HR people are very nice and very skilled. They would need to be, given the employee churn at Ubi Montreal. * Devs on the teams I was on were generally friendly and helpful. * ""Interprojects"" concept is good -- when your project is shut down or (less likely) published, you are put in Interprojects department rather than let go, so you can be interviewed/considered for other projects. This is smarter than the way most companies handle employees who are temporarily without a project. * Free French lessons (a necessity if you want to smooth communications with your teammates).","* Taxes are incredibly high in Montreal. Between Canadian and Quebec taxes, you lose roughly 40%-50% of your salary to taxes. This is not an exaggeration. U.S. developers should ask for at least 40% more than they get in the U.S. so as not to take a step backward in salary! * French is absolutely the predominant language at Ubisoft Montreal (it's even worse at Ubi Quebec). In my 9 months with the company, I estimate that at least 75% of all conversations, maybe more, were in French. Some official meetings were conducted in French. At one formal teleconference with the Editorial Board over in Paris, they asked if the meeting could be conducted in French, even though they knew 6 of the 8 devs on our side of the monitor were primarily English-speaking. * Editorial Board in Paris has a stranglehold on every decision. They don't micromanage on a daily basis, but any decision made by team management can be overturned at any time by Editorial, regardless of cost to project or team. The project I began on had been in development for 2.5 years when Editorial suddenly told us we had to switch from first person to third person, we had to go from a linear game to an open world one, and oh by the way, we hate your protagonist, change him. Each of these was a massive shift that was suddenly dumped on the team. And then 1.5 months later they canceled the project, after these changes were well underway, with lots of crunch involved. Stupid management, amazing any decent products have ever come out of Ubisoft. * They have a lot of hoops to jump through in their production process, lots of ""gates""/greenlight hurdles the team has to pause regular production to prepare for. Despite this semblance of accountability, all three projects I had contact with were way over their schedule and wallowing slowly toward completion. I believe only one of the three actually came out. * Without a doubt the most political game development company I've ever worked for (out of seven). Politics affect every decision and hindered every project. Ubisoft Montreal is the epitome of ""it's not what you know, it's who you know."" That maxim is what Ubi Montreal is all about. * Montreal is a very expensive city to live in, compared to large U.S. cities. Crappy little apartments are expensive and everything above that is too. * Commuting is very bad. The trains are good, the buses are really bad (at hitting their schedules). Don't bring a car if you move there. It would take me 45 minutes to go 4 miles, at 7PM. There can be massive traffic jams at any time of the day, on any major highway in the city, no rhyme or reason to it. * Drivers are awful; Montreal is the only place I have ever heard of that had to rescind right-on-red rules for cars because drivers were such a danger to pedestrians in crosswalks. Apparently pedestrian deaths have gone down but drivers aren't any better. Most drivers in Montreal seem to be in a hurry to reach the site of their next accident. ;)",7 people found this review helpful
Project Manager,"Jul 13, 2015 - Project Manager in Montreal, QC",3,"The usual pros of the games industry. - No suit and ties - Many people who are passionate about making games. - A good amount of great creative minds. - Flexible hours (with core hours) - Company healthcare, dental and retirement plan","- Like many already mentioned, if you do not speak French then expect never to rise beyond a specific level and jump many more hoops than your French speaking colleagues have to as well as your salary might end up in the lower area. This is even more painfully true in the Montreal office. - Your career may be blocked by the fact you do not speak French as well. - Many managers are promoted experts without the training in management or leading other people which turns out to be a dangerous approach in general, not only for Ubisoft. Some of them do know better but don't apply their knowledge, which is even more sad. - It happens too often that you try to dodge red tape and have to avoid stepping into someone's turf to get things done. Decisions often are made at a higher level and your are meant to apply them without a dialogue and prior conversation of sense or non-sense. - At times you are made to get things done without the necessary support or manpower. - Communication in the company has been very bottom to top with a lack of information flow from the top to the bottom while this is slowly changing, sadly too slow and as it seems only as a necessary evil. - Payment in Ubisoft is low not only compared to other industries which seems to be a common issue. Possibly because the games industry similar to the film industry always has enthusiasts willing to work for low payment only to be part of it. But even compared to the games industry Ubisoft seems to push the average bar low. - If you want to evolve and improve most the time you are on your own. While Ubisoft offers (internal) courses it is up to you to find your path. If you want to switch position or grow into another field then be prepared to experience a serious lack of support. There is no clear career path, no career coach, low (sometimes no) support from the HR. The summary: If you don't make it happen, then no one will (even help).",6 people found this review helpful

Very little innovation, most games apply the same 'game loop' of open up an area, do the quests in that area, go to new area, rinse and repeat. You will be expected to do a LOT of overtime with almost zero compensation. If you work 400 hours of overtime, you're lucky if you get 40 hours in vacation. Someone who leaves Ubisoft for a year and then comes back will almost always have a better position/salary then if they had stayed at Ubisoft.",6 people found this review helpful

"Reviewing Ubisoft in general, from a Toronto studio employee","Jun 12, 2015 - Level Designer in Toronto, ON",4,"Depending on which of the many studios, the opportunity to work on lots of big-selling franchises in a short amount of time The company is not known for mass layoffs, and is generally good about warning and supporting an employee when they are not performing before deciding to lay off Overtime happens, but you are compensated with extra days off after you roll off the project. Number of extra days is based on how much overtime you've done (not 1 to 1) Generally a good culture and great people to work with","Co-production projects can be highly frustrating when your studio is not leading the project, due to a lack of proper communication and planning Overtime (unpaid) does occur on, so far, all of the projects I've worked on Once in a while you'll feel like a small cog in a big machine, but that goes without saying at a huge company!

Massive turnover rate signals need for introspection,"Apr 15, 2015 - in Singapore",1,"Over the last three years, Ubisoft Singapore raised the bar in Singapore AAA game development. It produced Ghost Recon Online (now Ghost Recon Phantoms), one of the first wildly popular and financially profitable AAA games produced almost solely in Singapore. This proved that the local studio had the ""guns"" to make it big. It had talent. And it had nurtured even more talent through the grueling process of developing GRP. But please read on below.","Over the past year though a disturbing trend has been observed as more and more of that very same talent has begun to leave the studio in droves. Meanwhile ""positive"" glassdoor reviews that look suspiciously like they were written by the company's own HR department continue to appear. Perhaps it is time for some introspection Ubisoft Singapore. Ask yourself; how many of the GRP project managers, producers and game devs still remain in the studio? These were guys that worked 16 hour days. Persevered through 3 years of mad crunch. For little to no reward or profit sharing - and they still delivered. They became human capital investments that actually matured. They became the new talent base for future projecst. The studio's GRP-hardened veterans. They went through hell for their project and they didn't leave. Why are they leaving now? Do you think the trend can be easily dismissed, or is this part of a deeper cultural problem? What changed in the short year between the success of GRP till now?",19 people found this review helpful
Great Environment for those who want to make a difference!,"Mar 10, 2015 - in Singapore",4,"Open environment - Really helps on communication. Just take the initiative, anyone from senior management to junior employees are always willing to talk. Great Business Mind - Talk to more people who manages projects, department(s) and studio. You will pick up more knowledge about the company and business direction. The future of the organisation is bright in this competitive industry. There are many senior guys whose first job start in this company. That explains! Knowledge sharing - A lot of time, effort and money is spent in development of knowledge and training of the employees. There are many workshops created developed especially in the last few years. Values a lot on sharing expert advice (internally and externally). Not many games developers are doing to this extend! Local Talent Development - The Singapore studio emphasis the importance of developing top local talent. That's a very good area to develop and strongly encouraged!","Works with multiple studios collaboration. A lot of functions works with various studios and offices.

Disappointed.,"Mar 11, 2015 - Developer in Bucharest, Bucuresti",2,"I work in the production department. Decent benefits, good atmosphere for lollygagging and collecting a paycheck while doing a minimal amount of work. If you want a secure stress-free job without having to work too hard then this is the place for you. You don't even have to make up excuses why your progress is slow, because most of the time will be spent on waiting on other people to complete your work. Even now as I type this, there is a guy that is playing Diablo III and has been doing that every day, all day for at least 4 months back. Of the times I've passed by his desk on my way to the bathroom I've seen him either playing D3, or sleeping (Diablo 3 is hard work, that poor soul). Once or twice he had a spreadsheet or word doc open. If you wanna be like that guy, come work at Ubisoft you'll fit right in. The people I work with provide an above average social experience at the office.","Pay and advancement: There are a lot of little cons depending on what you are looking for. First it's the salary. They will never pay you more than you're worth. Some of the people I work with are very good at what they do and they aren't getting what they are worth. Advancement is also very hard. You would have to be twice as competent than you would need to be moved up to the next rank, for example junior to regular. It seems that Ubisoft is capitalizing on their name on your resume, and they will use that to pay you less. Looking around I don't see anyone over 30. There are a lot of young ones, so what happened to all the veterans? They probably packed up and left after they realized the same old ""carrot on a stick"" story wasn't going to pan out. This company just isn't the best place to be at if you're looking to climb the corporate ladder. You would have to be good at politics and be friends with the ones making the decisions. Merit alone is not enough. Ambient noise: Ubisoft loves open environments. If you're trying to program and you don't like noise, this isn't the place for you. You could put on some headphones and blast music to cover the chaotic noise and hear something more orderly, but is that really a solution? Bureaucracy: Nearly every project we undertook went *way* over the deadline due to constant unnecessary communication between different departments. I've had projects I've worked very hard on then got canceled at the last minute because they took too long. The server and network security specialize in dragging out opening a simple firewall rule (which should have been there in the first place) into a 2 week long ordeal. Combine that with HR's reluctancy to promote and increase salary and they have a very good excuse as to why they will not give you a raise. They will tell you ""well you haven't really done anything important here yet"" You're doing the best you can, but others don't respond to your emails, or doing their job and you end taking more and more tasks to fill up your time and then you end up in a situation where you're constantly juggling complex tasks. If you're a programmer or you actually get some satisfaction out of getting things done, this is a recipe for unproductivity and/or frustration. Pointless meetings: Every week we have at least 2 meetings in which topics are discussed which do not affect me or my work. They will fill your head with useless information that distracts you from your current work. Lack of control: Combine the above negatives and realize that the company is too big to listen to one little ant complaining. Change will not come easily if at all. No one actually cares if you are happy and productive (a good thing if you don't care either). If you're like me and you want to grow and make a difference, this isn't a good, long term opportunity.",9 people found this review helpful

There's no transparency in communications. Requests often reaches the floor with hardly any impact analysis on tech or team's velocity, and ideas are changed flippantly and frequently.

Also, working in insanely large teams, so you often end up being limited to one small component in the whole cycle. The work gets dull, repetitive, not enough challenges.

I've heard of teams that had their meetings and communications solely in French, and some people ended up having no idea what was said and what was expected.

Most of the people are pleasant to talk to and you can build a relationship with them after working hours.If you work hard and you are involved in what you are doing you have lots of chance in getting promoted.,"The HR department is a mess most of the time, you have to insist every time you want something to be done on time. The salaries are sometimes lower than for other companies in the same industry. Excessive overtime is done from time to time (especially near releases) mostly due to bad management or because of game design that changes randomly.",Be the first to find this review helpful
Politics rule them all,"Oct 3, 2014 - Senior Systems Administrator in Montreal, QC",2,"Highly talented staff, very casual attitude regarding everything.

Choose your friends wisely,"Oct 14, 2014 - Anonymous Employee in Singapore",1,"Ubisoft Singapore has, in the past, collaborated with other studios to create AAA games like the Assassin's Creed franchise. Great learning experience working on AAA titles.","The politics are incredible. Your skills account for 10% of your performance during the yearly review. The remaining 90% is dependent on who you are friendly with and who hates you. If a manager in the studio (not necessarily your manager) does not like you, he will find all sorts of excuses to have you fired. He will try to convince other managers that you are difficult to work with and if a majority of them speak out against you, you're out. On the flip side, if you're best buddies with your manager, he can find reasons to rally the other managers to his side and give you a promotion. Some have been promoted this way.",19 people found this review helpful

Ubisoft Pune: warm and friendly environment.,"Aug 20, 2014 - Artist in Pune",4,Projects have ambitious scope and are at the cutting-edge (it's a triple-A studio after-all); lots of employee outings/activities are arranged to encourage group bonding; opportunities exist for relocating to another of Ubisoft's many studios.,The usual problems that arise from bureaucracy (although perhaps amplified by the size and number of studios); salary is far too low given the demands of game development.,Be the first to find this review helpful
