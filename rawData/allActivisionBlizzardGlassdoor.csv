One of the worst companies to work for,"Oct 27, 2021 - Software QA Tester in Eden Prairie, MN",1,You get free games snack and all the coffee you can drink. Sometimes they order pizza for the office. Woohoo -_-,"Low pay Long hours Crappy benefits Insulting developers Infuriating co-workers Activision does a mass hiring every year for testers. 90% of the people hired will have a terrible work ethic, poor social skills, and poor communication skills. 5% will have all that plus poor hygiene, and the remaining 5% will be rockstar employees who take the job seriously. Everyone is paid the same, so the worst tester makes as much as the best tester. Good testers are rewarded with more work and responsibility for no extra pay. This creates resentment, and bitterness which results in good employees leaving who will then be replaced by more bad employees. At times it feels like working in a job that is one part office and one part kindergarten as just trying to get the majority of your fellow employees to behave like adults can be a futile struggle. All the profits go to the higher ups and they only raise tester pay if they absolute have to. This is the job where dreams go to die. Unless you're a kid looking for a summer job, avoid at all costs.",7 people found this review helpful

The work flow is pure chaos because there's no process set in stone. Pay ofcourse is bad eventhough the company makes millions of dollars. My manager is always talking about politics and vaccines and pushing his agenda on our team. It's makes us all very uncomfortable. Even the CEO and other VPs send out company emails and talk about the government/ vaccines in our town halls. They really shouldn't be talking about the government, about voting and the President. It's very unappropriate. I also think it's unprofessional because their views shouldn't be pushed on the employees; not everyone in the company feels the same way about these issues.

No weekends or breaks. We usually have a day off rotation that is assigned over three weeks, but recently we were punished for taking time off and not included in that rotation. Activision can easily afford to allow their testers a better quality of life, but don’t understand basic management. Burnout is regular and you will grow in disdain towards the countless gratitude emails they will send you. Turnover is incredibly high because testers usually leave from the overworking but underpaying position. There is no competitive pay and promotion to a better paying position is limited. We should not have to depend on extreme overtime to afford a basic studio apartment. Activision needs to be better. Their management needs to treat their workers like actual people not a stat to keep costs down so Robert Kotick and Dennis Derkin can get another multimillion dollar bonus. I want to love the job, but we need to be better as a company. The people working there deserve it.",1 person found this review helpful

It used to be a company that emphasized having fun and keeping employees engaged. Now, it's become a revolving door of people who used to be passionate about the company and wanting to leave for something better. Management constantly lays-off individuals every year (or people leave), and instead of hiring someone to back-fill the position, they spread the work around to the people that are left on the team and expect them to do the work with the same amount of pay. This is a constant problem seen in every department. This year's compensation was the worst anyone at the company has ever seen. We have seen record profits (unfortunately due to COVID), but have seen record low raises. The company seems to care more about profits instead of retaining talent.",3 people found this review helpful

If i would have found this job when i was younger i would stay a lot longer.,"Sep 25, 2019 - QA Tester in Bloomington, MN",4,Working at Activision is amazing in so many ways. The people around you are helpful and fun to meet and talk to. The management is better than most jobs ive had but still could have been better. If you enjoy playing video games or are in to the video game industry this job is everything you want it to be and the pride you will feel being apart of the industry is real. The pay while not being amazing is def worth the work and during crunch times you will make lots of money because of the over time. The place is a VERY inclusive work place for any and all backgrounds and for the most part everyone feels included and can make friends in a safe environment. i absolutely love working here and i wish i was at a point in my life that i could stay but because of the con its just not able to work out for me. if i would have found this job several years ago i would probable still be working for this company to this day.,"No life, especially on the night shift. if you work nights during crunch you are forking 12 hour shifts 6 nights a week. It instantly kills all social life you have outside of work. This at first didnt seem like that big of an issue for me but all my relationships are falling apart because i get one day a week to see anyone or do anything unless i sacrifice my sleep. also the length of work is questionable. its a full time temp position meaning your employment is limited and most dont even last the full length because they lay people off due to company needs. so job security is non existent.",1 person found this review helpful

Studios seem to be more in charge of creativity in their games but Activision manages more on the giving the deadline and can rush development even if a game doesn't feel complete. But this model has been working successfully for many years which is why change probably won't happy any time soon.,8 people found this review helpful

Behind the times...,"Jan 12, 2019 - Manager in Santa Monica, CA",1,Fun employee events and free game time. Great if you’re a dude passionate about gaming.,"Activision is an extremely siloed organization and the bonus system makes collaboration a non-starter (unless goals are aligned). If you aren’t a man, expect to be asked about your “passion for gaming” even after you are hired. They give lip service to diversity, but without cleaning house of the misogynists in leadership, nothing will ever change. Activision is a publisher in a time when indie studios can publish, distribute and support a game just fine without all the bloat of a traditional publisher. But, Activision isn’t making changes to make sure they survive, except yearly mass layoffs which kills morale. Also, be prepared to make way less than you are worth, be marginalized if you have ideas or come from a more forward-thinking company. It’s no wonder the C-suite is dropping like flies. No one wants to do anything different or move into the future—much less the present. They’re almost a year without a new CEO. That can’t be a good sign.",5 people found this review helpful

Hopefully that will give you a picture of what the job is like. Your KPI is also the amount of bugs that you've written (they care a bit about quality, but quantity is mostly what they look for).

The constant, high level of turnover - even after pay increases - should be eye opening but the remaining employees just get worked harder to make the management look good. Bringing up an alternative opinion to managers/leads will not be met with open ears, but rather will be punished for trying to improve the status quo.",12 people found this review helpful

Not what everyone thinks,"Jul 24, 2020 - Administration in Irvine, CA",1,Coolish swag Dogs on campus!!! (Pre-COVID) Environment: Nothing better than being on Blizzard campus and being in front of the Orc statue!,"Personally if I could have given Blizzard half a star I would have. Working for Blizzard is one of the most horrible experiences I ever had to go through. That feeling of,""OMG I want to work for Blizzard."" Quickly changes when you start and becomes,""OMG what have I done?!"" Management: Good ol boys club. 98% of management have been there for 10+ years and were a part of the company during its ""golden years"". Management is stale and tends to shun/discriminate against you if you do not agree to their every word. Their word is the bible and shall not be questioned! They hand out write-ups like its candy and tend to keep to the groups of tenured people. If you complain to HR, they say they listen but normally just ignore you and then say you never told them. Overall, management is just bad here. Fellow Employees: Some are cool I'll admit but most of them feel like they are high and mighty because they've been there for so long. If you're able to find a good click of people then thats great! I'm lucky I have but I have seen new employees come on board and are shunned and felt to be unwelcome. I was one of those people until I found a group I clicked with. ""Diversity"": Blizzard preaches that they are very diverse but when it comes to hiring, 8/10 will be men. There are barely any women in leadership roles and those that are tend to be ignored or overruled by those higher than them. The clubs that are on campus are run by fellow employees but even that is a mess. With the amount of work everyone has on their plate, their last thought is on groups. Many events will be ""planned"" and then cancelled which isn't necessarily anyone's fault but it proves that diversity and accepting those who are different really isn't a top priority. Advancement: Not gonna happen. Like I said, everyone in a management position has been there for 10+ years and they're not moving anywhere so your only option is to look for a better position outside the company. From what I have seen there is currently a very high turnover rate at Blizzard. Pay: Low of the low. If you work at Blizzard and want to live in Irvine, you'll either need a lot of roommates to cover the bills or someone who is throwing out money to you. Pay raises are very rare! Also, don't ask for a raise. If you ever do you're looked at with disgust and told to get back to work. Work/Life balance: LOL! Oh and never ask to work from home (Pre-COVID) Current higher management is very anti-work from home.",12 people found this review helpful

This results in very talented individuals coming aboard in the san francisco office (as well as NYC), but those individuals soon realize their talents are wasted working for a division that should be outsourced. Top talent leaves within 24 months. Top talent should avoid this employer moving forward.","I have never been a part of an organization so utterly lacking in culture. The San Francisco office is a morgue. Leadership does not interact with anybody, preferring to lock themselves in rooms all day, ""solving"" problems the company does not care about. The politics and self-importance are horrific and disgusting. It is remarkable that anybody is still there, and I heard regularly from my peer group that those who do stay do so purely for financial reasons (the pay is competitive outside of equity). The leadership team has no chemistry, the president is out over his skis in terms of experience, the marketing team is full of people who have no prior marketing experience, the product team has never actually shipped a product, and the sales team is embarrassed by the products that they bring to market. Most importantly, the division is not a priority to the company, but a sideshow that they wish to see revenue from, but otherwise wish would disappear. It is remarkable that the division has yet to be shut down.",17 people found this review helpful

If you're a young person that can handle being fed through a meat grinder as a QA Tester for a couple of seasons, the pay is decent (though you won't get benefits unless you elect to receive them and pay a hefty premium nor will you receive a bonus) and you'll get plenty of overtime making the paychecks pretty nice.

Corporate Services Professional at Activision Blizzard,"Mar 29, 2017 - Anonymous Employee",5,"The people here are the best I've ever worked with over a 20 year career. I know companies all say that, but here it's 100% true. The caliber of talent, the amount of fun we all have, the (mostly) lack of ego with everyone I work with... it's absolutely incredible. I've made close friends for life here; when some of them leave, they've all missed the culture and the people dearly. You'll see some harsh critiques from me below, and it's only because I think AB could be even better, but I can't say enough about the quality of work, the amazing products, the ambition to be the #1 entertainment company of the 21st century, the bright future, and especially the incredible people. Amazing team and still has a startup mentality -- often in both a good and bad way, but mostly good.","The processes and systems are not strengths here, but again, the place seems to attract such inspired, talented, entrepreneurial people that they more than make up for that. The AB leadership team is incredibly competent and focused, but they should be way more communicative and proactive about getting in front of employees. I know they appreciate the huge sacrifices employees make for the company, but could do a TON more to actually show it, like socializing with us more and offering more interaction and visibility; also giving everyone access to a stock purchase program and not just handing out equity to the magical ""Directors and above"" cutoff. We ALL work very hard here. A lot of the ways to recognize that effort are free. Walk the building. Talk to us. Let us ask questions. Again, all that said, I can't say our cons outweigh our pros.

Give it a shot.,"Jul 4, 2008 - QA Tester in El Segundo, CA",4,"This is a QA perspective: They hire from within, and if you show them some loyalty and competence they will return the favor. The atmosphere at work is great, and the managers are nice to the testers. They can definetly relate and do their best not to treat us like high school dropouts, which so many other QA testers in other companies are treated like. They also have an excellent training program over a week's period, so that when you get to working you feel like you know what you are doing. There is lots of overtime pay to be found at Vivendi as a QA tester.","This is a QA perspective: Even with loyalty and competence it may still take you up to 3 years to become a permanent tester. The pay is low and there are no benefits. (Although this is common with all QA jobs) There is usually only alot of work during the summer months. Alot of the testers get placed on Call around winter. And I felt that it was really up to luck on whether you would get work through the winter months or not. Even if you were really great at your job, if the timing was not right, then you were not kept.",Be the first to find this review helpful
"Fun while it lasted, never had the chance to succeed","Jul 18, 2008 - Software Engineer in Los Angeles, CA",3,"People were mostly very competent . Fun environment , easy going , relaxed , flexible hours . Advanced within the organization . Compensation was standard . Bonuses very good ( thanks to blizzard ) . . .","Products never got enough marketing support . While a fun place to work due to the people, employee morale was in the middle of the road due to product lack of success . No great hits . Another year or two and we may have had a shot . Will never know what might have developed in 09 - 10. Lots of good stuff was in the pipeline - all gone now due to merger .",Be the first to find this review helpful

"Good work athmosphere, bad HR.","Mar 15, 2022 - QA Localization Tester in Dublin, Dublin",2,"Good work athmosphere and and excellent and helpful mindset between workers, and even with the project leads. Company has made some efforts in giving us more stable jobs recently (more permanent posts, a small pay raise that should have come years earlier...) but only because of the huge sexual harassment and inequality at work concerns raised earlier this year. It's not complicated once you understand the tools you have to use. Learning curve is a bit slow at the beginning but team leads are very understanding about that.","Project leads don't know how to plan for overtime weekends. We get 2 days notice for weekend OT even though employees asked about weekend work more than a week before and we know making a team in advance is completely possible (it's easier to tell people they won't work in the end than telling them to volonteer for extra work 2 days before the weekend, but it looks like this concept is too complicated for them as it happens every single month on every project). Also, we don't get paid for being on-call. So be ready to say no to OT unless you want to cancel your plans for two weekends a month. As a tester, if your language is common, you are replacable, and as such you get paid less than some colleagues who do the same job for a different language and your contract will not get extended past two years.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Great place to start off your career,"Jan 11, 2022 - Project Manager in Dublin, Dublin",4,"- Great team within the PM corner, and overall everyone I work with is friendly. - The job is interesting with lots of challenges and fires to deal with. It is almost never boring.","- Lots of overtime and it isn't always avoidable. The team, including myself accepts this but in the long run this doesn't seem sustainable. - Money isn't great. Comparing PMs in external roles, the pay could be much higher. Our QA and LS teams suffer more with the cost of living in Dublin. - We are also not paid overtime. This is considered part of our core salary. - Compensation is appreciated, but is far more generous in other companies.",Be the first to find this review helpful
