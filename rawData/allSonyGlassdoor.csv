Upper management refuses to make decisions then blames employees for lack of progress. Too many people in the org don't have any understanding of security or good enough IT knowledge to work at this level. Moral is low in most groups.

Not sure how long that experience will last though. The SW developers seems to have become a bit more unleashed and some nice UX is coming along on the upcoming phones. The old platform (OSE running on Ericsson EMP) has been moved to China and focus is now on Smartphones, and some nice form factors are about to be released using some of the leading Smartphone OS'es. Pretty relaxed work environment, but appearances can be decieving as this is consumer products after all, and deadlines have to be kept ?!? Well, at least that applies to the grassroots.","Horrible standards of communication from middle management and up. You basically can't trust anything they say as far as major developments go, as they prefer to keep people in the dark, one can surmise, to ""increase productivity"". Lack of clear focus. Even now they can't focus on one platform (Windows Mobile, Android, Symbian) but split forces, focus and team on 2 or 3, with duplicated efforts. Madness or Genius? Take your pick. Even when they had 20-30+ phone projects going on, Sony Ericsson still had the appearance of a startup company in terms of organizational efficiency, learning from past mistakes and Quality Control. Too many chiefs and not enough indians to execute their vacillating wishes. Probably this could be blamed on having 4 major development centers around the world, each competing for resources and duplicating some efforts, but the failure to succeed in the US, one of the biggest and most competitive markets, where high value and quality at reasonable cost became unattainable. Dont' even mention low cost phones. Not possible for Sony Ericsson, Perhaps high end $700 smartphones, the final frontier, will keep the ship afloat a few (2-3?) more years... But with the maintained lack of focus of developing for several platforms, using duplicated development which do not communicate with each other, it looks more desperate (read: same old, same old) approach than a serious comeback. I hope I'm wrong because if they had REAL leadership able to forge a ONE MIND team this company and its engineers would probably kick ass.

The salaries seem to be relatively competitive.","There is definitely a glass ceiling for engineers. This may also be true for engineering careers in general, but if you are in a specialized area that is where you will remain. There is the constant threat of layoffs, of course. The Research Triangle Park site is a satellite site with little political power. It is a puppet resource to be used up until the day it is no longer competitive. There is a feeling that all of the design sites are competing with each other, which goes against the lip service of ""we must all work together.""",1 person found this review helpful

I have confidence in the brand name and its recognition that preceeds my reputation and helps me earn respect wherever I choose to go.","The only real downside I experienced was that they looked down on my having a personal life, and any time family came first I was ostracized and led to believe that a promotion was at stake if I did not put the company first.

A great company that needs changes now,"Sep 18, 2008 - Accountant in Miami, FL",4,"Great place to start your career in the cense that there is opportunity to growth and since it's a global company it's a great place to travel and discover new places around the world. Like every communication company there are some pros and cons. The pros in this case are; brand recognition and the quality of the product being produced, great environment to work in since the average age is below 35 years old, great perks and benefits to employees within certain areas or regions, and finally door open policy with upper management which is always great to express concerns or issues.","Unfairness between departments and employees. Favoritism to certain employees is present. Lack of recognition between departments and team work is totally lost. As I mentioned before there are some pro and cons, but in this case I will mention only the cons; extremely salary gaps between employees within each departments, unfavorable conditions to minimize excessive expenditures, lack of processes to reduced cost or pretty much any thing, lack of head count to support overall company growth and quality as well, and finally like every company there is bureaucracy within Sony Ericsson and changes are needed to prosper as a whole.",Be the first to find this review helpful
Not a great company to work for but good enough for work life balance.,"Jul 31, 2008 - Senior Engineer in San Jose, CA",2,"Work life balance is quite good. The management gives some value to your personal life. Also, the pressure to deliver is less. But as far as a Japanese company in US goes, this might be the best company. The benefits are long term oriented. It used to be that jobs at Sony were stable enough for the long term oriented benefits but no longer is the case. The jobs in US are mostly research oriented. So, it is easy to find highly skilled people here. Stock options used to be selectively given but this might have been stopped as of now. Knowing Japanese is an advantage here.",Quite a lot. The culture is very different. Everything is very secretive. The employees are not communicated from the top. There is a very deep heirarchy and it is difficult to people who are accustomed to US style of working to adjust. Not knowing Japanese is a big disadvantage as people talk in Japanese during meetings. Very limited Growth opportunity. Management does not have guts to speak out or do something radical. Compensation is quite poor compared to the industry. They have asked me to not share salary details of my future company with the current co-workers to stop them from leaving.,4 people found this review helpful

Sony Ericsson - Approach with Caution,"Jun 12, 2008 - Technical in Morrisville, NC",1,"The promise of the Joint Venture - the design and consumer electronics expertise of Sony married to the wireless expertise of telecom behomoth Ericsson sounded like a dream come true. Great benefits. Rank and file employees truly some of the nicest people you'll meet. And when we have a product for the US, they are among the coolest phones out there sans the iPhone.","SE in North America has lost some real talent in the last couple of years - a former president worked hard to recruit execs that came in from Sony, Coca Cola, etc...we guess they just got tired of not being able to achieve results - rumor had it the VP of Marketing had no budget - how do you expect to build a brand in a hyper competitive market with no budget? She left and they appointed a real flake into her role. There has been an almost yearly turnover in executives running the Product Business Unit - the group responsible for making phones - generally speaking it is almost always a Swedish national and they rotate in and out with regular frequency. Mainly, the most surprising thing is that the company does not invest in the US market. Despite protests otherwise and long speeches by every executive that ""this is the year, we'll turn things around in the US"" they still only manage to bring 1-2 phones to this market and most often have major quality problems with those handsets. We've heard that every year for the past 5 years. They also invest nothing in marketing or branding except for some stange reason a sponsorship with the women's tennis program. Internal politics are so thick you could cut them with a knife. People try to move around to other jobs, but the selection process mostly driven from the HR department is screwy at best. .",Be the first to find this review helpful

AVOID!","- Salaries and benefit packages are not competitive especially given commute costs (from London or other). - You're stuck in the middle of nowhere so your lunch break recreation/food options are limited. - Misleading job descriptions means you may end up in the wrong role. - Destructive and bullying senior management that encourages a toxic backstabbing culture within the team, and often ridicule employees in public. - Favouritism for Japanese employees. - Backwards culture that rewards loyalty over ability. - Management by fear. - Outside (non-Sony) experience is not valued. - Backwards culture that isolates women. In an office of 400 employees, not a single female in a leadership position - in this day and age! - Misleading bonus structure proposed by line manager with the knowledge that targets are completely unachievable and out of your influence. - Overtime is demanded by managers, but withholding the key fact that overtime can be claimed back. Why do you hide this benefit from your team? - Certain incompetent employees are protected by senior management so they stick around for years despite all stakeholders (including HR) being aware of their deficiencies. - No empowerment at all, no decision making-power even for positions that require 10+ years of experience. Complete micro-management. - HR try to be supportive but their hands are tied by strict archaic culture that protects the wrong people. - Working from home is not allowed except for extreme circumstances (snow, etc.). Again, in this day and age! - Destructive culture that highlights mistakes/areas of development but offers zero support or solutions. The worst part was the lack of team spirit, encouraged by managers. Constant bullying, backstabbing and being thrown under the bus.

Some people are working 1 day from the office (according to rules only 1 day working from home is allowed). Cons: it can be demotivating to see that there are a previgilant ones . Regarding salary. Average on the market, no salary rise, it is linked to a title promotion. To be promoted there is a queue of employees to be promoted so it will not happen. Promotion is linked to personal loyalty and office politics. So no salary rise. So negotiate from the beginning. If you see yourself spending hours in a kitchen talking to people drinking coffee, working 1 hour a day probably this work for you. If you want to improve your competences and work on something challenging and you want to see a clear ladder to climb, try something else.","Cons: for 150 employees around 20 managers, you will be reporting to several ones. Almost all the personal spend time on the meetings. No clear plans, plans are changing every month, there will be no chance to be responsible for anything. Cons: Low technical level of managers. Strange decisions, you will be forced to work using something you will not use in your future work. Poor technical feedback, you will learn nothing from it.

Big disappointment,"May 2, 2019 - Expert Software Engineer in Istanbul",1,Annual leave. (18 days instead of 14 days) Free coffee,"Turnover rate is so high. Most of the developers are leaving the company in a short period (less than 3 years). There are just a couple of employees, most of them are managers, team leads who have been working for more than 5 years. You hear cost cutting usually in the IT meetings. Firing employees, even they perform good, is not unordinary. Sony is losing market share and they are trying to survive by cost-cutting. Sony Turkey is also being smaller. (When I started, there were approximately 90 employees. After 6 or 7 months, there were around 65 employees.) Sony Turkey works on a project basis. They have a unit for each project. When the project finish, they are closing the unit. Then they may fire you or may suggest another role if exists. (Sony Turkey cannot get new projects, Sony India is getting new projects because of Indian's lower cost employee advantage. ) I worked with a bad manager. She may be one of the worst managers that I worked in the last 11 years. She did not know the technology well. When there is a problem, she even could not understand the reason for the problem. She says just do this, do that; like a typical boss but she just says the obvious and simple tasks. When there is complexity, you could not get help and feedback from your manager. Even you need to explain the situation, sometimes you need to explain technical things. Sony Turkey is too far away from being innovative and high-tech.",1 person found this review helpful

Rubbish - don't waste your time for the hype of this dying 'Brand',"Nov 13, 2018 - Assistant Manager in Dubai",1,"If you are a wash-out and have no other employment prospects with a true reputable company, pros for you would include: Great work-life balance! Unless you live in anywhere near Dubai or in Sharjah, then expect a (roughly) 2 hour commute ONE WAY in the company bus. Their HQ is halfway to Abu Dhabi. No need to stay and work late, unless your boss is working late too. Show your dedication to work, stay on doing nothing for no overtime. Oh, and if you have a car, be prepared to be told they have no space in the lot (all reserved for the bigwigs) and wont take responsibility for any muck-ups that may happen on premises. Free Lunch! Oily, unhealthy, tasteless food, dirty pantry and lack of choice. Great way to stay in touch with your Doctor. If you don't want it, no problem! Ask them to not give you lunch and bump up your salary in lieu of, and let us all know if you succeed. Multicultural environment! Yes, among the sea of Indians and Filipinos, you may spot the odd Arab or Pakistani, except ofcourse for the HODs who are mostly all Japanese and don't socialise much. Also, employees love spending time at work to cater to everyone's religious festivals; I mean why not? You're expected to stay on late anyway, might as well dance around and put on a couple of skits. Employee Engagement at the cost of a family life or time at the gym, you'd be stuck in traffic anyway, yay! Career Progression! Haven't received an education above a bachelors from an unheard of university? Haven't stayed up to date and relevant in your chosen field? Cant get ahead anywhere else? Got 5 years to spare to move up? Come on over! Employee discount! Learn about the tiny margins and then jump through hoops and red-tape; this comes naturally if you're used to working in the failing government entities or 'developing nations'. Be grateful you're getting anything at all! Simple! Yes, no need to use your experience, education, wits or industry know-how, just do what they tell you to do and no need for any inputs. I mean hey, surely these guys are still number one for a reason right? They haven't slipped at all in terms of product, R&D, marketing at all right? Right? Long term vision! The Heads keep rotating every 3-4 years and so are only concerned with their immediate results, who cares about long term goals or presence? That's a great strategy, let's keep everyone as happy as possible for now, let the other guys figure out the issues when they crop up, I certainly won't be around. Pay and benefits! Haven't you heard? They're the best! You'll get the lowdown when you join and learn about the Compa-ratio. Be grateful, you get free lunch, company transport, 'employee engagement', and other things which SOUND great...if you haven't worked at a proper MNC or first rate firm before.","No cons....except that you will meet some really great people who will leave before the year is out when they realise that all the Pros above don't really work out for high-performance people with two brain cells and good industry experience. Don't believe me? Do a LinkedIn search for yourself. I should have done it and saved myself the headache of working for a great company ruined by sub-par people who couldn't jump ship because no one else would take them. Simple coworkers! No drama as all the ones that have stayed are such lovely, docile, gentle folk. Busy lil worker bees all buzzing about to get a job done like drones. If you're lucky some will actually tell you truth and how they feel, but most are happy to live risk-free work lives and not make an actual effort to contribute to making the place better. Sheeple. They say that age and where your passport are from don't matter; the pattern would suggest other wise, but hey what do I know, I've only been working in HR in this part of the world for a decade.... If you feel the review has a lot of vitriol, then reach out to someone who has left the company in less than a year and ask them why. Otherwise you're more than welcome to dismiss this and take the risk, it doesn't matter to anyone apart from you, your career and your family.",2 people found this review helpful

A successful company moving too slowly living on past glory,"Sep 28, 2018 - Anonymous Employee",3,Highly ambitious projects are achieved eventually and the company is comfortable to be an early adopter of change. Sony Electronics is the most organised of all the Sony sister groups.,"The speed of change is ice age slow, the decision matrix for simple changes is ridiculous. The culture is one of consensus before change which slows down decisions greatly. Culture is stagnant and not cutting edge as you'd expect from a well established electronics company. Innovation of a broader product portfolio is poor. New versions of the same category of products are released year after year. Aibo, PlayStation Classic and releasing a watch well after everyone else has done it are examples of a lack of innovation. Mainly only Japanese men will achieve high level roles, although there are a few examples of diversity in the US. There is a culture of the haves and have not's amongst sister companies, PlayStation and the rest. Feedback is requested through global employee surveys but it is a lip service exercise and no action is taken.",3 people found this review helpful

Expectations were to work insane hours to be promoted without overtime pay or commensurate time off. There seemed to be way too much ""busy work"" and admin tasks not relevant to generating business, or enhancing profitability, that were expected. This created a culture of ""Backroom Managers"" that were unable to effectively sell, coach, or inspire their staff to perform. The baseline take home wage of a sales person in the organization was very low compared to the amount of knowledge expected of them. The ""bench"" of Assistant Managers waiting in the wings to replace tenured managers was very weak, and when called upon would inevitably flounder.

I feel all above prior reviews are correctly written. !","I have worked for more than 2 years as a software engineer in Sisc. * Cons * Sony Needs a Salary Analyst. Sony's payscale is way below industry standards. Sometimes a difference of 50% is normal. * HR is meant for supporting staff in their operations. Here its a complete opposite. * Work environment is worst. They recruit people from low ranked colleges, most of them doesnt have enough skills to work in s/w domain. Their recruitment is only for support and testing. Even a Bsc can do so. *1 year of on-job training for a fresher is of no use. They lack mentoring in each and every phase. * Employee benefits are less compared to other companies. Only insurance and discounted products are of use. Charges for cab services are too high. No subsidized food. Even after paying you cant get the quality, quantity and taste. No work from home facility. * The company has no faith on their recruitment. You cannot take even a stationary item (Stapler, Marker etc. ) all from yourself. It requires managers approval. The only TV at the cafeteria wont play Cricket matches. ! such things will irritate you. You can see cost cutting everywhere. Evening snacks timings are 6.30-6.35pm. Yes, they last 5 mins only. LOL * Once you leave the company, and try to contact the HR for your final settlement, They will not respond untill you drop them 5-10 mails. Once it happened to me that I didnt get my notice period's last months salary. But my other frens who were serving the notice period did get it for full 2 months, every month. Further, The variable pay is not prorated for the employee who is leaving the organisation. Another cost cutting. This shows the way that payroll people are doing their job. ! * Leaving process at sisc will leave you frustrated at the company. Even if your project work is completed and it doesnt require for you to serve 2 months of notice period. They wont relieve you before 2 months whatsoever. Even if the employee has some personal problems to deal with, they wont leave you. Because its a matter of billing for them. They dnt care about staff's personal views and plans. A Complete waste of time. What you get after working 2 years is complete despair and disappointment. * SISC is a Billing Machine. It works like this. Recruit any kind of guy. Charge the innocent clients for them. Pay very less to your staff and keep all the money in your pocket. ! New people will come after seeing sony's brand name . So, they are not short of applications any time. ! * Appraisal process is amazing here. ! Yeah, its really is. The manager who meets you not even once a month, and who is heading a team of 40 people does your appraisal. Manager doesnt know the amount and quality of work you have done, he doesnt knw what issues you have encountered and you have solved. Further, You are not involved in your managers appraisal. There is no kind of feedback loop whatsoever. * For a fresher, there is a service agreement for 2 years. The worst part.",2 people found this review helpful

No freedom to do anything apart from work. This kind of behavior tends to eat up your brain. 4) No facilities for employee like other companies.

Subcontracting and poor organization somehow fails to bring them down...,"Feb 25, 2011 - Sony 3D Ambassador in London, England",2,everyone knows of it pay was decent good products,"poor poor management - I had about 4-5 different managers, none of them were familiar with my working hours, none paid attention to the problems I raised, none provided feedback and support I was asked to fill in useless reports that had an unrealistic deadline - e.g. work till 6, need to get them down by 8 and the reports themselves take a minimum of 1.5 hours and need to be done from home!!! a manager pulled rank on me once when I complained about lack of time and reminded me he was my manager?!!? As if that gives him the right to demand the impossible!! Stock was always missing and that was embarrassing in front of customers Staff on site was not aware as to what my duties were -- random managers tried to boss me around and tell me what to do, which was frequently not my job Salary promised was not what it turned out to be Unclear policy on days off - I was never given one despite asking",2 people found this review helpful
"People try hard, Management needs to improve decision processes, eliminate ""NIH"" syndrome, improve company co-operation","Feb 1, 2011 -",4,"We had some of the most enthusiastic people working together towards a common goal. Many good processes, checks and balances in place. There was a real desire to produce innovative and high quality products. Some products were really great","Products not always designed with the best quality, often because there was insufficient time or resources (or both) to address all of the issues prior to launch. Processes not always followed or were made to be impossible to follow with the time and personnel available. Measurements of project management was often hihgly focused on launch date and little else. Project Managers were not held to a project from cradle to grave, causing poor follow through on issues. Money wasted on ridiculous marketing but made limited attempts for the North American market. Decision to eliminate the design unit at RTP was political and spoke volumes as to how important that market really is to upper management. This may not be the final blow for that market, but extreme attention must be given to address all customer issues in order to keep the customers they have and impress new customers. A lot of good experience was lost in the last downsizing; many of those people would've gladly worked together to improve, but the leadership was too willing to take improper risks with the products to get them launched on time. Sometimes this worked, but sometimes it didn't.",Be the first to find this review helpful

No official training provided, thrown into the fire and you sink or swim. Favourtism obvious with certain managers. Terrible overall compensation.

Ultimately working under a flawed business structure where revenue available is shrinking every year and employees are expected to navigate 20 years of poor business decisions/waste and a failing record industry (not music industry as a whole).
