Terrible place,Developer,"I simply cannot recommend Ubisoft to anyone. In fact, I feel that I have an obligation to warn people about the place.Stay away!",1,,
Terrible organization with no values,Developer,"Working at Ubisoft was probably the worst experience of my life. The pay is low, the projects are horribly managed resulting in lots of crunch, and there is an abundance of nepotism and infighting.The cat came out of the bag last year when multiple outlets wrote revealing pieces about what a toxic workplace Ubisoft is. And I am absolutely convinced that Ubisoft will never change its ways. If they take any steps it will be to salvage their reputation, but the toxicity will never stop since it is ingrained into the depths of their culture.",1,"Nepotism, low pay, toxic culture, abusive environment",

Overall a good place with good people,Marketing Assistant,"Temp worker here. Was involved in many of the full-time worker activities.

Currently cannot recommend working there to anyone.,1,"Worked on some big AAA projects which was a cool experience, met some cool people","Low pay, lots of nepotism, dishonest managers, bad culture, a lot of people leaving in the past months/year"
Do not join QA/QC,QA Assistant,"-Employees are afraid to speak their mind. I have been reminded on multiple occasions by management that I am paid more than Ubisoft Pune employees and so I need to prove my worth. This cultivates a culture of fear.-Extremely high turnover. Massive batches of new people come and go every few months; you are just a number.-During your onboarding, expect to be introduced by HR to a wide range of good initiatives like Creating a Safe and Respectable Workplace and platforms like Whispli. As well-intentioned as this is, these initiatives are treated like a joke in the department, with even management cracking jokes like “Later I Whispli you”.",2,"Work-life Balance, Informal environment","Empty promises, Poor career advancement, toxic workplace"

"Extremely toxic place, everyone is leaving",Coordinator,"I worked at Ubisoft Sweden for 5 years. Ubisoft is a terrible company to work for. They encouraged toxic behavior for years and when the public found out about how they had ignored massive sexual harassment complaints, as well as countless reports of bullying from abusive managers, they put on a fake act pretending to listen. Ubisoft actually doesn't care and will never change, they are just trying to save face. I witnessed coordinated harassments and the person whom used racial slurs at me during my time at the company has now been promoted to a lead. Absolutely despicable company with the most abusive managers imaginable.",1,Entry to AAA game dev industry,"Low salary, toxic workplace, abusive managers, coordinated harassments, bullying, etc"

Busy day and barely compensated,Support Representative,"Barely compensated for the amount of work and stress put on you. Management is basically non existent unless they need you for something, Workplace culture everyone is to their self. Team mates and other employees don't care for others but is a big show to flaunt the company as for good for the public.",2,Somewhat flexible work schedule,"Not enjoyable workplace, Horrible Management, STRESS off the roof, unappreciative of their workers"
Quintessential work hard; play hard environment,Developer,"Typical game dev environment with flexible work hours, but you are expected to put in around 10-11 hours of work a day.Great place to launch your career, but promotions and compensation adjustments do not reflect rising cost of living in Toronto.For a ""fun"" work environment, the company is very much bogged down by bureaucracy.Workplace culture is extremely cliquish and juvenile, common in many ""young"" companies. Benefits are not as appealing as other tech companies in the city. The hardest part of the job is separating work-life and personal life, as most of your colleagues will not hesitate to respond to an email after hours or during weekends. Not doing so will reflect badly on your performance. Also, difficult to move up the ladder if you do not speak French.The most enjoyable part of the job is working on a globally recognized brand and interesting product.",3,"Interesting projects, cutting edge technology, collaborative atmosphere","Long hours, slightly discriminatory towards anglophones, corporate red tape, juvenile work culture, lack of benefits, non-responsive HR, unfriendly IT department"

"Unique, challenging and fun workplace unlike anything else",Assistant Front-End Web Developer (Customer Relationship Management),"I worked at the Ubisoft Montreal studio for 4 months as part of an internship with the CRM team. As a software engineer with a creative streak and a need for human interaction in the workplace, this office was the definition of perfect: comfortable desk area, natural lighting, and a genuinely great balance between work and leisure.Ubisoft Montreal being a video game studio means that, by default, your work involves play. This does not mean that play becomes work, strictly speaking; an average day at work didn't feel completely like work, and that's impressive.The best part of the position I had was the connection our team had with the other teams in different departments. Marketing and customer relations are a nexus of graphic design, brand integration, data analysis and customer feedback. If you enjoy this level of interconnectivity, you'll enjoy this position.The hardest part (other than saying goodbye) was the holiday rush. Work hours became packed and long at the same time, and the stress levels can get pretty high. That being said, this is predictable and should be expected if you're aiming for a marketing-adjacent position like this one.",5,"Employee benefits, amazing workplace",Long hours during marketing rush seasons

"Fun place to work, good work parties",Data Analyst,"The office has a really chill vibe and most people are very nice and really care about each other. There are always fun events going on and lots of free stuff such as T-shirts, cool meeting rooms, and lots of games can be played around the office. The salaries seem fair and people seem to be happy. Even as a non-gamer I still felt welcome, but it is an especially fun place for gamers. Good benefits, including being able to play games during work hours. Also got the opportunity to go to the E3 event in Los Angelos.",4,"events, free stuff, nice people",None
Avoid this place at all cost,CRM Integration Specialist,"They overwork you and they do not care how burnt out you are. They expect you to work long hours and they don't allow you to bank any of your overtime hours. When you do take a personal day, they still call you for help. The managers don't help you move up. They gossip and talk about you and pretend to be your friend. It's an awful place to work. I would not recommend this place to my friends or family. IAvoid thi",1,Bagel Fridays,"Overwork, long hours and extremely stressful."
An Amazing Workplace,Junior Gameplay Programmer,"Ubisoft is a great place to work as. With a friendly culture and helpful people around, I was glad to have my internship there. The reason why I was not able to stay at the company was due to my own personal problems, coupled with the covid virus situation.",5,"Friendly staff, chances to improve are frequent",No cons to me
Decent remote position,Seasonal Contract Support Representative,"OverallI will have to say that they did provide me another chance after my no call no show, but I got fired for something that was totally out of my control. Even after I reported it to the appropriate channels, their communication was asinine",2,,
Not so bad but no so good!,Game Tester,"The benifits are really cool with flexible timings and free breakfasts as well as the people working in some depts. are really friendly and help you out whenever you need them. However, I would say the pay as well as balance between work and personal life is lost here. If you truly think work is your life, you are at the right place. But, if you think you need to have a personal life, this might become problematic. The HR system is broken in a way that if you try to make them understand someghing they might not understand at all maybe because they do not have knowledge of what that dept. actally does(they have an overall knowledge but not what it truly is).",3,"Free Breakfast, many good people, amazing learning experience","Salary, Hr, Internal Politics"
Laid back workplace with all necessary tools and training,Customer Support Representative,"I would come into work and grab some coffee and then head to my desk. The shift started with checking my email and getting my desktop set up for the shift for the day. I would speak with managers to see what work was to be done for the day and then get to work. For every 8 hour shift, I would receive an hour lunch and 2 15 minute breaks. The management was super helpful and always looking for improvement which led to me becoming a better employee. The work environment was very laid back and there was no dress code so coming to work in comfy clothes was nice. The hardest part about the job was learning about computer troubleshooting since I had no background in that field and it was a lot to take in at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy and helping them with the issue at hand.",5,"Freedom to work from home, helpful managers and employees, technological advancement","A lot of time spent behind a desk, lots of screen time, tiring at times"
Not worth the sacrifice,English Support Rep,Great job if you don't need the money or you live with your parents or have roommates. Wages wouldn't cover my mortgage even with full time hours. Was let go after I turned down working full time because I was already sorting a full time job in addition to part time here to pay bills.,3,"Fun company sponsored events, cool work environment","Poor pay, poor work/ life balance, lots of favoritism"
One of the best jobs i have done working with ubisoft and its people,Game Tester,Working with Ubisoft on unreleased games was amazing as you can see the progress the game takes and how valuable your critics and opinions are during those sessions.

The only positive thing about this place were my coworkers. But even then...,Customer Relationship Supervisor,An absolute mess of top-down management. Keeps everyone in the dark and then gaslights any employee who complains. The agents who did most of the work were wonderful but management is poor and manipulative.,1,,
"Interesting company culture, no clear ownership accross the company.",Marketing Product Manager,"working at Ubisoft is interesting. The company structure is clearly broken and employees suffer from lack of vision from upper management, lack of clear ownership, lack of clarity on your future in the company. But this cleary varies based on the project you work on. Your salary is not competitive, you are expected to work constantly, pour your heart and soul into your work, but in the end, what is most important isn't your talent, it's how long you sit on your chair at work and how many years you burn giving to the company.

Work conditions are catered to quantity and not quality, they care more about the numbers than the quality you would want to put in helping the player. Also, if you are not in the inner circle of higher ups working there, then forget about, is not a secure job and always have a backup. ( I mean no job is 100% secure but this takes the cake) always think about having a backup plan y you plan to join. Make sure to be on time and ready to work, CRC is very strict on attendance policy, no matter if you have an emergency or you feel terrible and all you want is to lie in bed, you are expected to bring what they call their thought of a valid excuse (death note, doctor note, court note, army note) signed and printed, even if you had an emergency along the way to work expect to bring a valid excuse or else it will count as a warning or strike. You barely get vacation days unless you have have slaved yourself to earn them. Now you do learn lots of technical support for pc and console that will help you with other jobs as well as a sense of what goes behind the scene in a gaming company.

This can mean you work 4 months at a time on at least 3 different occasions before you ever get the opportunity to get full time employment. Some employees will work as temps for a year or two straight, at a time with no full time offer. While working as a temp employee, the benefits are bad (high health insurance costs, low pay, minimal gaming benefits, no company incentives/rewards like free gear or invitation to holiday parties which full time employees take advantage of) and you are treated very unfairly compared to the full time regular employees. The management is rude and doesn't know how to respectfully and professionally communicate with their employees. When asking for assistance with a case one manager will advise me to proceed in one way; a day later I will get a rude email from another manager telling me what I did was wrong.

Friendly coworkers and no risk of layoffs,Part of the production,"There are two big advantages to working at Ubisoft. First, they hire more friendly people than the other studios I worked at in the past. Second, they haven't done any layoffs. Their plan is actually to keep expanding. The downside of working here is the salary. It's 15-30% below what you can get elsewhere. Ubisoft has been lucky in the last 4 years, feeling no pressure to raise salaries. This is because Toronto doesn't have much of a game development industry. There is a single other studio around the city, which is Rockstar. So, no competition for talent. The other downside is that you likely will feel like a pawn at some point here. This is to be expected, as most teams are above 200 people. If you think that's a lot, in Montreal, some teams peek at 900 people. There has to be some advantages to working at small companies right? Another reason you may feel like a pawn is that even if the Toronto studio had good intentions for its people, many of us got shuffled and moved to new roles and projects due to another studio's needs. So, you may be excited about your current project and giving it all you got, and suddenly, a directive from Montreal demands that you help them with a struggling project. This should not come as a surprise as the industry is highly risky and a large company must do what is best for itself as a whole. Also note that this could only be temporary. Back to talking about the positives, this is a place where you will never feel like you risk of being let go due to company finances.

Great work environment...bad management and communicative skills,"Modeler, Texture Artist","The work environment was amazing. Every amenity an employee could ask for. Training was available at all times. People were friendly and helpful. Management has no clue what they're doing. All art directors do not know how to communicate making it impossible to complete tasks to their own personal vision. Perception is a huge factor there. If you arrive early 8:00am (two hours before most management arrives), and leave 2 hours before management leaves 4:30pm , you're perceived as not putting in 100% effort. But if you sleep in and arrive at 10 am and leave at 6:30 PM then you are perceived as putting in your all. It's very broken. Same amount of time...just a small shift later. Overall, you're not treated as a person...but as a number.",4,"Work space, facilities","Management, Art Direction"

"I woke up at crazy hours for this job, however it was incredibly enjoyable.",Beta Tester,"I woke up at around 5AM to work in Canadian timezone, it was by home so they would email me an update code, or tell us to update the beta when they had it updated, this part was very efficient, however the people chosen the manage the all together were quite dis-organised, dealing with them was quite difficult as sometimes they didn't even show up for our hours, and we'd have to organise ourselves on Skype. The job was home based so we'd converse through Skype, the rest was very fun and enjoyable, my co-workers very nice and were really good to talk to, the most enjoyable part however was definitely the gameplay part and the actual taking part in the job itself.",3,play games before the release date,"crazy hours, small pay"

Contractors highly expendable--be careful.,Notetracker,"I was hired on a temporary contract that started with two months training on proprietary software and lots of subjectivity in how the work was to be completed (gotta respect the NDA's, so I can't offer up details). Worked very hard, loved the gig, even though the software was buggy enough to cause work loss regularly and supervisors gave us contradictory information as to how the work should be completed. Of the four of us hired (through multiple interviews, BTW) two of us were let go six weeks later for the vague ""We have an idea of what level you should have been at by this point."" I was immediately told to clean out my desk and escorted to the street as if I were caught stealing. Serious problems in organization and management on this particular team.",2,"one free lunch, well stocked cafeteria, nice guys on my immediate team.",being fired for not being trained properly while still in the training period!

Innovative company with a great culture,Business Analyst,"Ubisoft is a great company to work for. As with any company, there are some cons, but the pros heavily outweigh the bad. The work-life balance could not be better, as the culture there is one that endorses a commitment to bettering your personal life. They offer free drinks on all floors, and have weight loss competitions and other company wide games with prizes that encourage camaraderie. They often give away free games and always have Christmas gifts for the employees, as well as throw many company parties throughout the year. Communication within the company could be better, as different groups are sometimes on different pages regarding big decisions.

Assumere per portfolio e competenze,game designer,"Bisognerebbe iniziare ad assumere personale in base al portfolio, a prescindere dall'età o dalle scuole frequentate. Basta continuare ad introdurre ragazzi e buttarli nel mare dicendogli NUOTA!Non esiste il candidato perfetto , ma di certo dopo aver lavorato con alcuni artisti con un portfolio non buono, di contro ho visto rifiutare o addirittura nemmeno prendere in considerazione alcuni buoni 3d artist , quando vedi questo genere di cose è molto difficile credere che esista una selezione onesta e corretta, perché di fatto non c'è. Allo stesso modo di come non funziona la piattaforma usata per il recruiting di personale e non aggiungo altro.

Da riorganizzare la sede di Milano,"Milano, Lombardia","A malincuore devo confermare quanto letto da alcuni ex colleghi purtroppo.Vita privata quasi assente, scadenze progetto imbarazzanti, ovviamente chi manda avanti la baracca non è mai chi poi ne prende i meriti in fase di premiazioni varie ed eventuali.Zero possibilità di assunzione di senior oltre una certa fascia di età...in sostanza quelli bravi stanno a casa. Ma soprattutto assumono solo se hai il nome sui crediti di un titolo, altrimenti no, oppure dalle scuole o tramite segnalazione da parte di qualcuno stop e credo questo non sia giusto.Mi dispiace poi confermare quanto letto su altre recensioni....il mainstream infatti è potente...in pratica prendono persone sulla base di feedback ricevuti da altri, senza dare possibilità di vedere se sia realmente così.Stiamo rovinando, ma già da un po',anche questo di settore in Italia, creando delle caste lavorative. Che peccato.",1,Sviluppare videogame,Molti
