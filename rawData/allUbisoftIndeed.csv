As a software engineer with a creative streak and a need for human interaction in the workplace, this office was the definition of perfect: comfortable desk area, natural lighting, and a genuinely great balance between work and leisure.Ubisoft Montreal being a video game studio means that, by default, your work involves play. This does not mean that play becomes work, strictly speaking; an average day at work didn't feel completely like work, and that's impressive.The best part of the position I had was the connection our team had with the other teams in different departments. Marketing and customer relations are a nexus of graphic design, brand integration, data analysis and customer feedback. If you enjoy this level of interconnectivity, you'll enjoy this position.The hardest part (other than saying goodbye) was the holiday rush. Work hours became packed and long at the same time, and the stress levels can get pretty high. That being said, this is predictable and should be expected if you're aiming for a marketing-adjacent position like this one.",5,"Employee benefits, amazing workplace",Long hours during marketing rush seasons

I have learned a lot about project managing, team managing, international collaboration, inter-departmental collaboration and I even received the right of selecting the new comers, checking their CV and conducting the interviews. As a localization tester I was continuously improving my vocabulary in different fields, for instance when I have worked for the game ''Hawks'', I had to be up to speed with all the military terminology, then when I worked for ''From Dust'' I was I had to learn new geological or climatological term, and so on.

Friendly coworkers and no risk of layoffs,"Part of the production (Current Employee) - Toronto, ON - December 7, 2013","There are two big advantages to working at Ubisoft. First, they hire more friendly people than the other studios I worked at in the past. Second, they haven't done any layoffs. Their plan is actually to keep expanding. The downside of working here is the salary. It's 15-30% below what you can get elsewhere. Ubisoft has been lucky in the last 4 years, feeling no pressure to raise salaries. This is because Toronto doesn't have much of a game development industry. There is a single other studio around the city, which is Rockstar. So, no competition for talent. The other downside is that you likely will feel like a pawn at some point here. This is to be expected, as most teams are above 200 people. If you think that's a lot, in Montreal, some teams peek at 900 people. There has to be some advantages to working at small companies right? Another reason you may feel like a pawn is that even if the Toronto studio had good intentions for its people, many of us got shuffled and moved to new roles and projects due to another studio's needs. So, you may be excited about your current project and giving it all you got, and suddenly, a directive from Montreal demands that you help them with a struggling project. This should not come as a surprise as the industry is highly risky and a large company must do what is best for itself as a whole. Also note that this could only be temporary. Back to talking about the positives, this is a place where you will never feel like you risk of being let go due to company finances. The proof is that the company hasn't been profitable lately (public - more...",4,No layoffs in the history of Ubisoft Toronto,The pay is 15-30% below what many other studios offer
