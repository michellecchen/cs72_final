Overall Good Learning Experience,Product Lead,Company is passionate about making a difference in the industry and for players. I learned a lot about the pros and cons of a solid company culture. You get to work with a lot of passionate talented people. Org experienced some growing pains at the time as it matured further and sought to develop its identity and structure as an organization.,4,"On-Campus Cafeteria and fairly stocked Pantry, Playtests, Culture, Learning and Development Courses","Lower Salary, Inter-team Politics due to structure and organizational models"

One of a kind job experience!,Catering Coordinator,This was a one of a kind job experience. A lot of pros but then the cons would be management. Many people were put in manager roles with no experience.,3,"Free food, fully stocked kitchens, company events",A lot of managers that showed favoritism and had no idea how to manage
Fun place to work,Project Manager,Riot will keep you busy but it is a fun place to work. They care about their employees and handled covid well by quickly sending folks home. They also provided everyone with 1k to help setup their wfh setup.,5,,
"Unable to grow in company, unless willing to accept management's political views.",Player Services Representative,"The long standing culture at Riot Games is one of misogyny, false wokeness, and ""locker room talk"". Over the years it has become a factory for managers with little to no experience who are hired based on their relationships to executives at the company to grow their resume while under performing in their role.",1,"Free food, games on break","Company culture, management"
"Riot's not a place for everyone, but THE place for some",Contingent Workforce Manager,"Riot's a unique company still catching up from an infrastructure standpoint from their massive expansion and success in the early 2010's. Being a part of that growth is challenging, but there's no better feeling of satisfaction of accomplishing your goals and making an impact in that environment, and an engaged player base. Riot is not for someone looking to coast for a little while, if you try to coast you'll stick out like a sore thumb.",5,,
Great working environment filled with passionate people,Web Content Associate,Everyone here is passionate about what they do. It's always easy to meet new people and start new conversations. Everyone here works hard and also knows very well how to balance that with good fun.,5,,
"Worked on the Support Team, not at the HQ",NA,The job was demanding and the payment was not worth what was asked or required. Often time the team would be lead along with dreams but very little compensation followed,2,,
Great company to work for,eSports Team Captain,Lots of talented colleagues and great company culture. I had a blast working for the company and felt well compensated. I've grown a lot as a person through my commitment in working at Riot Games,5,,
Don’t bother if you don’t breathe videogames,Technical Recruiter,"It doesn’t matter how exceptional you are at your craft:if gaming isn’t your heart and soul you will be shunned. Note: I like playing games but not for my first hour of the day at work, 2-3 hours a day in the afternoon, another hour of games on campus after eating there, then going home and paying for several more hours with Theo-Le you just played for 5 hours with during the work day every single day. It’s worse if you’re a girl there is a very specific mold they expect there",1,,
Agile company that learns from its mistakes,Lead/Senior VFX Artist,The culture is second to none and the desire to have a positive work environment and willingness to help employees grow in any area they want is what Riot is all about. But you better love games!,5,,
Comfort Zone,Live Services,"Many folks fall into a comfort zone which leads to complacency, as it’s impossible to get fired here. The same complacent managers are recycled year after year with no accountability for results.",3,Work Life balance,Lack of any manager accountability
Great,Broadcast Producer,Was a great place to work day to day with wonderful people always willing to help you grow and succeed in your goals. I have nothing but good things to say about the people and culture. It always felt like home coming into a job I thoroughly enjoyed.,4,,
Great work culture,Facilities Manager,"I loved working for riot games, the culture was incredible and I felt very useful and accepted. there was always opportunity for growth. The most enjoyable part of the job was coordinating the live shows.",4,,

Final event organizer who had the best reception of all participating universities in Mexico. n",5,,
Look for the helpers,Data Warehouse Administrator,Great place to work and learn new skills. Also a great place to build relationships with experts all over the world. Problem spaces are complex and vast and fun to work through with a collaborative team.,5,,
Fun environment for gamers,I'd rather not say,They allow employees to be themselves. Trouble is if one of them is very negative they don't stop them. That's both good and bad! It's fun getting free food and lattes!,4,,
Fun but Exhausting,University Ambassador/Volunteer,"I work as ambassador and my duty is organize tournements for university students. The hardest part is human relations,students i mean players are so demandfull and to compansate their demands somtimes i tell lies eventually they get what they want. Second thing is taking no money because i am volunteered but,for voluntarly job its too exhausting.",4,Free products of company,Work for free
Best Companies to work with and for!,TEAM LEAD SPANISH TEAM,"Well, Being totally open abut my review will mean to say that Riot Games are basically my Hero Company! I cant tell anything Bad for them. All aspects are 10+ and they keep listening and updating! Wow, just WOW",5,,

Fun work place with poor management,Catering Coordinator,I loved working here in the beginning. During my employment I had two managers who had no idea how to manage. There was also no room for growth. And there was only one raise during the time I was employed.,1,"Free breakfast, lunch and dinner",Horrible management
Gaming Company with Gaming Culture,Admin,"The company is trying to include more minorities and more women but it skews heavily male. Employees are expected to give 110% but playtime is also encouraged. Interview/hiring process is long and intensive. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with dedicated, smart employees who are passionate about delivering the best.",3,"Great benefits, lots of perks, beautiful campus, smart and competent coworkers.",Lack of women in management roles.
"A wonderful environment, but don't get too comfortable",Specialist IT Engineer,"Riot Games tries to create a laid back business culture, where colleagues can build trust and speak frankly with one another. With people acting like friends and playing games every day, it can be easy to forget that you're at work. Never forget that you are at work. There are supposed to be metrics and improvement plans to help employees meet and exceed expectations, but not all teams have that in place. If there's a perception that you're not delivering enough widgets, prepare for unceremonious termination.",4,"All your needs are taken care of, the people are great","Pressure to stay in the office, for all hours."
"If you're passionate about games its good, if you like having a life and being compensated for your skills, not so much",Sr. Quality Assurance Engineer,"I took a pay cut to join Riot games, and while I enjoyed the experience overall, now that im more senior in my career, looking back there were faults. Compensation is horrible, especially within QA. Leadership is promoted beyond their skills and cannot properly mentor their reports you have to be a cliquey kiss up to succeed in this company",3,"beer at meetings, subsidized dinners, good peers","horribad compensation, long work hours, cliquish people, leaders caught in scam"
Player focus is felt throughout all we do,Live Services / IT Lead for LatAm North,"The work culture at Riot feels very much as it's advertised on the tin. It's very comforting to have conversations with lots of brilliant people really looking out for player experience in everything they do. The like-mindedness of rioters and a natural motivation is what makes many teams create awesome stuff or simply have a very successful conversation with a new peer without having to lay heavy ""intention"" context. I've really enjoyed my time at Riot, working alongside many very passionate and very smart people and with the opportunity to learn and experience completely new crafts. What I love the most about Riot is that you're actually encouraged to get out of your role and explore your other interests. You're an engineer who likes champion art? Go have conversations with the art team and maybe propose a skin concept that may end up getting some attention. Riot truly is a very interesting company at which to grow, learn and become awesome in the video game production industry.",5,,
Manager,Manager,"The people make this organization work -- not the leadership, not the broken processes (where they exist). It is the relationships that drive decisions and enable the company to do what it can. The interview process is a fair representation of what it's like to work there -- if you enjoy that process, you'll love working there. If you dislike it, then no amount of money will make the work experience better.",2,,
Cult,Accounts Payable Specialist,"Yeah it was great at first...... The place is a cult, and I could not see until the ride was over. The company culture is lazy and sluggish. They have one product since they stole someone else's hit game.",1,Free Lunch,Work life balance is non existent
"A company I loved and admired, but riddled with management woes",Software Engineer,"I honestly loved the advertised culture, but Riot has changed a lot in the past couple years. There is very little room to advance, and in general, the company doesn't seem to have a solid vision or strategy for where it wants to be in the next year or two. I feel that many of the leaders don't know how to enact policy or really help the organization evolve positively. I mentioned that Riot has changed a lot, but it hasn't been due to the leaders making the engineering organization better; it feels more like a slow erosion, where they try to maintain a status quo and often stifle any rumblings of change.",3,"Lunch and dinner are fully subsidized for now, ""Unlimited"" PTO, Shared Success Plan","Limited growth opportunities, difficult to affect change, leaders preach a culture of feedback, but rarely display any effort to change."
Very fun place to work,Accountant,"Riot Games by far is the best company to work for. Unlimited PTO, 401k matching. They also have a great work life balance. The only negative regarding Riot Games, is there is no room for advancement. Riot tends to hire from outside rather then promote from within. Therefore you can find yourself stuck in one position for a long time.",5,"Free lunches, unlimited PTO, Holiday vactions",No advancement
"Fast-paced, continuously evolving environment","Los Angeles, CA","I loved coming to work and every challenging project that was given to the team. I learned a spectrum of skills from creating PO's for finance, creating guidebooks, workplace safety and guidelines, security, IT, Leadership skills, construction, and so much more. Management for my department specifically has never had a ""safe"" environment and felt like a shark tank. The team members pulled together to exceed expectations of the services we provided and we managed to achieve successful operations without the guidance of Leadership or Direct Managers. The hardest part about the job is that any problem or challenge can arise with no moments notice and may involve time sensitivity or impacting situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to create relationships throughout Riot in turn teaching and learning new things everyday.",3,"Free Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Arcade, electronics perks, great benefits. Meeting life long friends you can depend on.",Management is very unstable. No advancement opportunities for the hard working people at the bottom.
Unproductive place to go to stagnate,Project Coordinator,"There is no room for growth here. If you're hired, you probably won't be doing what you applied for. Management is a ""boy's club"" and a joke. Not challenging, if you try to do more or improve and make changes to a poor process, you're pretty quickly shown the door.",1,Free food?,"Political, toxic mess"
Great place to grow,Live Broadcast Technical Director,"A great place to work for a hungry individual not just because they offer free lunch and dinner at their cafeteria, but also when it comes to growth in the company and as an individual. The culture is rich and fun.",5,,
Great gamer culture with growing pains,Facilities Assistant,"The Facilities department has some Job Security/Advancement issues, however the workplace culture throughout the company is phenomenal. Facilities in particular does have a rather poor work/life balance, however it also tends to be extremely satisfying within that team as they have an extremely amazing camaraderie. Benefits are extremely competitive, compensation could use some work. Management is growing and adapting constantly. But ultimately this place is heaven on earth for any gamer looking for a place to have a career.",4,"Free lunch and dinner, PC Bang + Arcade, Nap rooms, beautiful campus","Occasional political feuds, growing pains, feeling guilty about having to leave the office at the end of the day"
@Riot,Senior Illustrator/Concept,"A great place to work and live. Don't forget we have a campus and we are all in High-school again, staying up late playing games and working on what we are passionate about.",5,Free food and $300 Gamefunds a year!,weight gain and less sleep
"Awesome place to be, surrounded by super fun people.",Production Worker,I worked to set up for the Latin American semi final and everything about it was amazing. The people there all got along well and enjoyed what they did.,4,Fun events,
Very Fun Place To Be,Security Officer,"My primary function as Security Officer At Riot Is creating a visible deterrence For prevention of crime,customer service assist with the functions of physical and personal security and safety measures for clients and the general public, protect property from theft or damage. Other duties include access control, crowd control, list management,emergency response, searching, law, policy, and regulation enforcement.",4,Free Lunch,Bad Managment
Productive and Fun Work Place,Staff Accountant (Contractor),Riot Games Inc. has a very unique culture. This is a company definitely where everyone wants to be. I enjoyed my time as a contractor in Riot Games.,4,Free lunch and dinner,Job Expectation
A great place to grow and learn,Associate Manager - Merchandise,Is a fast paced environment that encourages exploration and values the input of all members on the team. The team is willing to take risks given proper thought has been given before launching a new initiative. The team will not continue down paths that are no longer viable and will pivot to new opportunities quickly.,4,,
Productive and unique working enviroment,"Transcriber, gaffer, grip and PA",Riot Games was by far my favorite job that I have had the pleasure of obtaining. My co workers were just the best people on earth. They were super knowledgeable in their fields of expertise and really helped me feel welcomed. The management was very easy to get used to and had no problems doing the tasks they asked for. The best part of the job was going on location and filming at Blur Studios. Got to see and work hands on with a lot of professional equipment. Best company to work for and their endless amounts of cereals made each day a whole lot sweeter.,5,"very hands on, great enviroment",Na
Exciting workplace with a gamer culture and a lot to prove!,Software Engineering Intern,"I learned how to build an API using Node.js; my project felt awesome, because even as an intern, my work was impactful and I knew that someday, my feature would ship to a live environment. Management is an interesting beast. As a software engineer, there's a few people at play that you have to be cognizant of. Development manager, which deals with developer relations and how productive a team can work. Engineering managers, which are technically ""the boss"" of a specific team and/or function, and ""product managers"", who drive the priorities and the workflow of the products of teams in play. The problem here is that even if the dev and the product manager likes you, if the engineering manager has a reason not to, you're out. There's nothing you can do to change that. Lesson learned? It doesn't matter who else you please, if your direct (engineering) manager doesn't like you, you're boned - good luck ever working there again. Co-workers were awesome - most of them were pretty young, but the odd time you'll encounter a ""dinosaur"" - someone who's been around for a few years and knows the tech stack like it's their own child (probably because they built it, heh!). The open office environment really lends itself to a greater sphere of influence and learning, since anyone around you can give you good feedback, and give you the tools you need to succeed. The hardest part of the job was really focusing on specific priorities - sometimes, a lot of work can come up, and you need to understand where to draw the line, and how exactly to ensure that you stay on top of your work - more...",4,"$10 off dinner if you stay late, game at work (breaktime!), gamer culture/atmosphere",work/life balance can be a challenge
"Powerhouse game developer, clinging to an outdated ""start-up"" mentality",Analyst,"Riot Games is second to none. Benefits and work environment are the best in the industry, but like everywhere else in game development, monetary compensation lags severely behind the enterprise software development companies. Perks like unlimited PTO, company-wide vacations and a semi-annual hack-a-thon make Riot an amazing place to work, but with meteoric growth comes problems of astronomical scale. Riot was built by entrepreneurs, and still clings to that ""we're a startup company, playing loose and cowboy with the rules in order to get the product out the door"" which worked in 2009 when Riot had startup numbers of employees, and players still thought that League of Legends was just another Warcraft3 mod. Now, with over 1200 employees worldwide, that procedureless, startup mentality is starting to bite Riot. Cadenced deployment, something that enterprise software and many other game companies perform without a hitch as a basic process of development, is still a rather frenetic and error-fraught process, as developers, artists and designers check content directly into the production pipeline at the eleventh hour, causing the teams responsible for deploying the latest patch worldwide no end of headache, and the appearance of reinventing the wheel every two weeks. That being said, the individual Rioters are nothing short of extraordinary. While people make mistakes all the time, there are very few who respond to problems with ""that's not MY job to fix"" and walk away. Sure anyone capable of checking in assets to source control should know how to do that properly, but when an - more...",4,"Unlimited PTO, excellent insurance of all types, great interpersonal environment","Virtually processless workflow, constantly shifting technologies, lack of communication."
Very passionate owners with a strong vision.,Associate Producer/Intern - PC Game,I directed the way characters would move in the game. Did some level and character design as well as help outsource assets with the producer. Hardest part about the job was my personal school schedule. The easiest was creatively collaborating with the design team.,5,,
Dream Team company,Russian Community Coordinator,"Riot Games is amazing company with great work environment, brilliant team and clear goal.",5,"Social activities, great team, benefits","Unpredictable working hours, which is normal for gaming industry :)"
A company on the rise,"Interim Country Manager, GM, MD, Russia/CIS",Riot will be very successful in the coming years. The opportunity I had was exciting and very successful.,3,,
"Work was easy, but little communication between the client and our office",Custom Support Agent,"It was okay, the people were nice. We did not know what was going on many times with the game, and little communication between the Austin and LA Offices. So it was hard to give players definitive answers to their questions. Quite frustrating and stressful at times.",3,fun work environment,"little communication, more just ""beating around the bush"""
