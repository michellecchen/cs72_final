Gaming Company with Gaming Culture,"Admin (Former Employee) - New York, NY - August 10, 2018","The company is trying to include more minorities and more women but it skews heavily male.

One of a kind job experience!,"Catering Coordinator (Former Employee) - West Los Angeles, CA - June 22, 2021",This was a one of a kind job experience. A lot of pros but then the cons would be management.

Fun place to work,"Project Manager (Current Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - January 16, 2021",Riot will keep you busy but it is a fun place to work. They care about their employees and handled covid well by quickly sending folks home. They also provided everyone with 1k to help setup their wfh setup.,5,"",""
"Unable to grow in company, unless willing to accept management's political views.","Player Services Representative (Former Employee) - New York, NY - August 7, 2020","The long standing culture at Riot Games is one of misogyny, false wokeness, and ""locker room talk"". Over the years it has become a factory for managers with little to no experience who are hired based on their relationships to executives at the company to grow their resume while under performing in their role.",1,"Free food, games on break","Company culture, management"
"Riot's not a place for everyone, but THE place for some","Contingent Workforce Manager (Current Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - May 8, 2020","Riot's a unique company still catching up from an infrastructure standpoint from their massive expansion and success in the early 2010's. Being a part of that growth is challenging, but there's no better feeling of satisfaction of accomplishing your goals and making an impact in that environment, and an engaged player base.

"Worked on the Support Team, not at the HQ","NA (Former Employee) - NA - March 16, 2020",The job was demanding and the payment was not worth what was asked or required. Often time the team would be lead along with dreams but very little compensation followed,2,"",""

Don’t bother if you don’t breathe videogames,"Technical Recruiter (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - November 26, 2019","It doesn’t matter how exceptional you are at your craft:if gaming isn’t your heart and soul you will be shunned. Note: I like playing games but not for my first hour of the day at work, 2-3 hours a day in the afternoon, another hour of games on campus after eating there, then going home and paying for several more hours with Theo-Le you just played for 5 hours with during the work day every single day. It’s worse if you’re a girl there is a very specific mold they expect there",1,"",""
Agile company that learns from its mistakes,"Lead/Senior VFX Artist (Former Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - November 4, 2019",The culture is second to none and the desire to have a positive work environment and willingness to help employees grow in any area they want is what Riot is all about.

Fun environment for gamers,"I'd rather not say (Former Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - January 29, 2019",They allow employees to be themselves. Trouble is if one of them is very negative they don't stop them. That's both good and bad! It's fun getting free food and lattes!,4,"",""
Fun but Exhausting,"University Ambassador/Volunteer (Former Employee) - İstanbul - January 22, 2019","I work as ambassador and my duty is organize tournements for university students.

Fun work place with poor management,"Catering Coordinator (Former Employee) - West Los Angeles, CA - December 7, 2018",I loved working here in the beginning. During my employment I had two managers who had no idea how to manage. There was also no room for growth. And there was only one raise during the time I was employed.,1,"Free breakfast, lunch and dinner",Horrible management
"A wonderful environment, but don't get too comfortable","Specialist IT Engineer (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - July 19, 2018","Riot Games tries to create a laid back business culture, where colleagues can build trust and speak frankly with one another. With people acting like friends and playing games every day, it can be easy to forget that you're at work. Never forget that you are at work. There are supposed to be metrics and improvement plans to help employees meet and exceed expectations, but not all teams have that in place. If there's a perception that you're not delivering enough widgets, prepare for unceremonious termination.",4,"All your needs are taken care of, the people are great","Pressure to stay in the office, for all hours."
"If you're passionate about games its good, if you like having a life and being compensated for your skills, not so much","Sr. Quality Assurance Engineer (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - April 30, 2018","I took a pay cut to join Riot games, and while I enjoyed the experience overall, now that im more senior in my career, looking back there were faults. Compensation is horrible, especially within QA. Leadership is promoted beyond their skills and cannot properly mentor their reports you have to be a cliquey kiss up to succeed in this company",3,"beer at meetings, subsidized dinners, good peers","horribad compensation, long work hours, cliquish people, leaders caught in scam"
Player focus is felt throughout all we do,"Live Services / IT Lead for LatAm North (Current Employee) - Mexico City, Mexico - April 24, 2018","The work culture at Riot feels very much as it's advertised on the tin. It's very comforting to have conversations with lots of brilliant people really looking out for player experience in everything they do. The like-mindedness of rioters and a natural motivation is what makes many teams create awesome stuff or simply have a very successful conversation with a new peer without having to lay heavy ""intention"" context. I've really enjoyed my time at Riot, working alongside many very passionate and very smart people and with the opportunity to learn and experience completely new crafts. What I love the most about Riot is that you're actually encouraged to get out of your role and explore your other interests. You're an engineer who likes champion art? Go have conversations with the art team and maybe propose a skin concept that may end up getting some attention. Riot truly is a very interesting company at which to grow, learn and become awesome in the video game production industry.",5,"",""
Manager,"Manager (Current Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - April 17, 2018","The people make this organization work -- not the leadership, not the broken processes (where they exist). It is the relationships that drive decisions and enable the company to do what it can. The interview process is a fair representation of what it's like to work there -- if you enjoy that process, you'll love working there. If you dislike it, then no amount of money will make the work experience better.",2,"",""
Cult,"Accounts Payable Specialist (Former Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - February 5, 2018","Yeah it was great at first...... The place is a cult, and I could not see until the ride was over.

"A company I loved and admired, but riddled with management woes","Software Engineer (Current Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - November 15, 2017","I honestly loved the advertised culture, but Riot has changed a lot in the past couple years. There is very little room to advance, and in general, the company doesn't seem to have a solid vision or strategy for where it wants to be in the next year or two. I feel that many of the leaders don't know how to enact policy or really help the organization evolve positively. I mentioned that Riot has changed a lot, but it hasn't been due to the leaders making the engineering organization better; it feels more like a slow erosion, where they try to maintain a status quo and often stifle any rumblings of change.",3,"Lunch and dinner are fully subsidized for now, ""Unlimited"" PTO, Shared Success Plan","Limited growth opportunities, difficult to affect change, leaders preach a culture of feedback, but rarely display any effort to change."
Very fun place to work,"Accountant (Current Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - October 30, 2017","Riot Games by far is the best company to work for. Unlimited PTO, 401k matching. They also have a great work life balance. The only negative regarding Riot Games, is there is no room for advancement. Riot tends to hire from outside rather then promote from within. Therefore you can find yourself stuck in one position for a long time.",5,"Free lunches, unlimited PTO, Holiday vactions",No advancement
"Fast-paced, continuously evolving environment","Facilities (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - September 15, 2017","I loved coming to work and every challenging project that was given to the team. I learned a spectrum of skills from creating PO's for finance, creating guidebooks, workplace safety and guidelines, security, IT, Leadership skills, construction, and so much more. Management for my department specifically has never had a ""safe"" environment and felt like a shark tank. The team members pulled together to exceed expectations of the services we provided and we managed to achieve successful operations without the guidance of Leadership or Direct Managers. The hardest part about the job is that any problem or challenge can arise with no moments notice and may involve time sensitivity or impacting situations. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to create relationships throughout Riot in turn teaching and learning new things everyday.",3,"Free Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. Arcade, electronics perks, great benefits. Meeting life long friends you can depend on.",Management is very unstable. No advancement opportunities for the hard working people at the bottom.
Unproductive place to go to stagnate,"Project Coordinator (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - June 26, 2017","There is no room for growth here. If you're hired, you probably won't be doing what you applied for. Management is a ""boy's club"" and a joke. Not challenging, if you try to do more or improve and make changes to a poor process, you're pretty quickly shown the door.",1,Free food?,"Political, toxic mess"
Great place to grow,"Live Broadcast Technical Director (Current Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - May 14, 2017","A great place to work for a hungry individual not just because they offer free lunch and dinner at their cafeteria, but also when it comes to growth in the company and as an individual. The culture is rich and fun.",5,"",""
Great gamer culture with growing pains,"Facilities Assistant (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - March 15, 2017","The Facilities department has some Job Security/Advancement issues, however the workplace culture throughout the company is phenomenal. Facilities in particular does have a rather poor work/life balance, however it also tends to be extremely satisfying within that team as they have an extremely amazing camaraderie. Benefits are extremely competitive, compensation could use some work. Management is growing and adapting constantly.

Productive and unique working enviroment,"Transcriber, gaffer, grip and PA (Former Employee) - Santa Monica - July 15, 2015",Riot Games was by far my favorite job that I have had the pleasure of obtaining. My co workers were just the best people on earth. They were super knowledgeable in their fields of expertise and really helped me feel welcomed. The management was very easy to get used to and had no problems doing the tasks they asked for. The best part of the job was going on location and filming at Blur Studios. Got to see and work hands on with a lot of professional equipment. Best company to work for and their endless amounts of cereals made each day a whole lot sweeter.,5,"very hands on, great enviroment",Na
Exciting workplace with a gamer culture and a lot to prove!,"Software Engineering Intern (Former Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - October 27, 2014","I learned how to build an API using Node.js; my project felt awesome, because even as an intern, my work was impactful and I knew that someday, my feature would ship to a live environment. Management is an interesting beast. As a software engineer, there's a few people at play that you have to be cognizant of. Development manager, which deals with developer relations and how productive a team can work. Engineering managers, which are technically ""the boss"" of a specific team and/or function, and ""product managers"", who drive the priorities and the workflow of the products of teams in play. The problem here is that even if the dev and the product manager likes you, if the engineering manager has a reason not to, you're out. There's nothing you can do to change that. Lesson learned? It doesn't matter who else you please, if your direct (engineering) manager doesn't like you, you're boned - good luck ever working there again. Co-workers were awesome - most of them were pretty young, but the odd time you'll encounter a ""dinosaur"" - someone who's been around for a few years and knows the tech stack like it's their own child (probably because they built it, heh!). The open office environment really lends itself to a greater sphere of influence and learning, since anyone around you can give you good feedback, and give you the tools you need to succeed. The hardest part of the job was really focusing on specific priorities - sometimes, a lot of work can come up, and you need to understand where to draw the line, and how exactly to ensure that you stay on top of your work - more...",4,"$10 off dinner if you stay late, game at work (breaktime!), gamer culture/atmosphere",work/life balance can be a challenge
"Powerhouse game developer, clinging to an outdated ""start-up"" mentality","Analyst (Current Employee) - Santa Monica, CA - August 29, 2014","Riot Games is second to none. Benefits and work environment are the best in the industry, but like everywhere else in game development, monetary compensation lags severely behind the enterprise software development companies. Perks like unlimited PTO, company-wide vacations and a semi-annual hack-a-thon make Riot an amazing place to work, but with meteoric growth comes problems of astronomical scale. Riot was built by entrepreneurs, and still clings to that ""we're a startup company, playing loose and cowboy with the rules in order to get the product out the door"" which worked in 2009 when Riot had startup numbers of employees, and players still thought that League of Legends was just another Warcraft3 mod. Now, with over 1200 employees worldwide, that procedureless, startup mentality is starting to bite Riot. Cadenced deployment, something that enterprise software and many other game companies perform without a hitch as a basic process of development, is still a rather frenetic and error-fraught process, as developers, artists and designers check content directly into the production pipeline at the eleventh hour, causing the teams responsible for deploying the latest patch worldwide no end of headache, and the appearance of reinventing the wheel every two weeks. That being said, the individual Rioters are nothing short of extraordinary. While people make mistakes all the time, there are very few who respond to problems with ""that's not MY job to fix"" and walk away. Sure anyone capable of checking in assets to source control should know how to do that properly, but when an - more...",4,"Unlimited PTO, excellent insurance of all types, great interpersonal environment","Virtually processless workflow, constantly shifting technologies, lack of communication."
