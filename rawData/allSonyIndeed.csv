Any perceived break in the ranks (pretty much any independent thought) will be punished harshly. Every employee is like a prison trustee motivated to abuse and inform management on other employees' behavior. You live to work. You are always wrong. The only bright side is that they paid us well to take this sort of abuse for 12 hours a day. Unlike American companies, they will not pretend to like you until they can find a way to get rid of you. Like Nike, they just do it. You're gone, and no worries about pesky state employment regulations or U.S. federal law.
