Employees report sexual harassment to their bos and nothing get done about it 
conservative management , inflexible to change 
Cronyism , double standard , constant negative feedback over petty issue all made for a miserable existence at Sony , despite how great the company is 
While the company 's overall culture wa good , the division 's culture wa one of insecurity and people looking out for themselves , rather than for the team 
Corporate culture can be seen a either a pro or a con , depending on how creatives view this 
Very corporate 
Moral is down , lot of layoff , business situation is rough 
Do not encourage those people to continue that behavior 
You ca n't ever get anywhere because all the upward movement is totally based on politics , and the Japanese do NOT care about your opinion-It 's their culture 
They expect you to work 80 hour like they do 
Japanese Culture may not be best fit for American employee

Management prefers to “ manage out ” toxic employee instead of firing them 
Worked Japanese hour around the clock , 8 am to 9 pm some day , 
Japanese hierarchy culture where feedback to innovate is not valued 
Nothing is considered negative here 
Many people at Sony have worked here for a very long time ; year and year ; that they are comfortable and not so compelled to push the envelope and try new thing 
Nothing is bad here it 's all great 
Treat people horribly , highly political and paranoid , no transparency or open communication 
Basic corporate culture 
Culture is cutthroat and unsupportive 
Local people feel they are not really valued 
if you want to get to the top you have to be Japanese 
Created a toxic/unaccountable environment 
Hours are extremely long and the culture of the environment is driven by competitiveness and fear of not succeeding 
Poor management ; everyone for themselves environment ; den of snake type atmosphere ; although there is a Ethics hotline , many employee are left unprotected and often retaliated against when they speak up 
dont feel respected at this company 
The japanese look at anyone not Japanese a inferior 
Refused to accept Samsung and LG a real competitor 15 year ago and lost the battle 
Although changing progressively , since a Japanese company , driven by concensus which slows down making decision 
Large company with old school politics 
Sony still tends to do thing the old fashion way and upper management do n't communicate with employee 
Long hour that are expected due to company culture 
Decision-making is slow and Tokyo-centric 
Sony 's not serious about this business 
Very rigid process driven organisation Not sale oriented and that is why they messed up properly 
HR department need replacing , some high level exec are more concerned with covering their behind than doing what is best for the company , no Employee Stock Purchase Plan , too much outsourcing , aging office ( soon this will change for the better ) , corporate culture need a makeover , my department enforced business casual dress code ( it the 21st century guy and Sony is not a blood sucking/soul destroying bank ) 
Do n't give in to the big name 
grow some value or go away because whether it 's technology , music , entertainment , camera etc 
The brand remains strong , but resource are thin and long term strategy is sometimes in question 
Old company , doing thing really traditional 
Ensure Sony ha a commitment to marketing and developing product for the US market 
Very Japanese 
Discouraging work environment , throw under the bus culture 
tough work culture with too much self entitlement 
Despite sharing an office with Sony Network Entertainment , we never collaborated with them , which wa representative of the fractured corporate structure 
The typical thing is for each internal business unit to look out for itself rather than the company and customer at large , which mean that while Sony often design great hardware , the interface and user experience and complementarity between product often fall short 
Bad work ethic , constantly forced to zone certain area , not to talk to other associate on the sale floor 
Mostly coasting on past glory 
Poor performing software , product developer not on board through entire product life cycle 
No free food , not even chip or yogurt 
No con at all , the culture is great to work 
Politics , lack of recognition , try to implement the japanese culture in the different market 
Japanese company are strict and are LOYAL 
The culture there wa rude , cut throat for I do n't know whatever reason , there wa A LOT of junk

Depending on which location ( retail ) you were working at , the work ethic of your fellow employee may vary 
A woman in the Japanese business culture is still discriminated against 
A few bad apple could really ruin the atmosphere 
Cultures sometimes did clash , especially when `` traditional '' executive from vendor would arrive and forget the `` When in Rome '' mentality 
Decision making relied on parent company 
Sometimes very Swedish minded which may not fit into all different culture 
Too Sweden-centric , everything must be accepted by management in Sweden Management too slow to make decision , leading to non-competitive product 
Even when they had 20-30+ phone project going on , Sony Ericsson still had the appearance of a startup company in term of organizational efficiency , learning from past mistake and Quality Control 
Too many chief and not enough indian to execute their vacillating wish 
Unfortunately there doe not seem to be a culture of openness willing to listen to critique 
They expected me to be available 24-7 and to always put work first 
The culture is very different 
There is a very deep heirarchy and it is difficult to people who are accustomed to US style of working to adjust 
Often lateral movement is not even allowed 
Expectation is to work long hour

Singapore team is pathetic Work culture need to improve 
Just a really bad workplace culture 
In some way still traditionally Japanese 
Sony a a brand want to be first again but in order to achieve that they have to invest more in marketing and into the people that work for them 
Have hardware centric culture on consumer electronics field 
A bit conservative , too famous , very stable 
I felt like home 
too strict 
Organization is orthodox , slow to change , averse to risk taking , 
Japanese management style encroaches on local way of working 
This in turn negatively affect cane husbandry practice 
Failure in duty of care 
no work life balance , no charity activity , old fashioned 
No transparency in team-goals or direction , often hard to see the big picture 
Carrier groth is very le 
Japanese culture & sometime decision moving slow 
it is a conservative company 
Backwards culture that reward loyalty over ability 
Backwards culture that isolates woman 
HR try to be supportive but their hand are tied by strict archaic culture that protects the wrong people 
Destructive culture that highlight mistakes/areas of development but offer zero support or solution 
The worst part wa the lack of team spirit , encouraged by manager 
bad company direction 
This is not a place to work if culture is of prime importance to you 
Costly cab facility not good cafeteria politics in team not good management always cost cutting 
Slow decision making and H/W centric culture 
Relatively old culture and age Tomb of excel file 
Rather conservative to new idea / change 
The culture is one of consensus before change which slows down decision greatly 
Culture is stagnant and not cutting edge a you 'd expect from a well established electronics company 
There is a culture of the have and have not 's amongst sister company , PlayStation and the rest 
Tough company culture and high level people 
Conservative at time , I guess 
Very orthodox 
work like a Japanese Company , slow in decision making 
* thorough regulation * legacy and traditional culture 
The mind is very Japanese that you are not so welcome to express the opinion

Silo mentality when it come to the different Sony company 
Harsh management when it come at being consistent when arriving at the office 
management doe not treat employee objective , fair and respectful performance doe not count they do not want employee who think independently and take personal responsibility for their work employee stay with Sony only because of the good relationship with their colleague but not because of the brand 
Constant pushing for more and more output with 100 % quality 
Encourages practice that break the store code of conduct in regard to aggressive sale technique 
Sony is a kind of traditional company , the speed for catch up the new biz mode is quite slow 
Sony aim to be really profitable which mean that Sony is very demanding and employee have to be very efficient and effective 
be punctual , working overtime , 
The company ( or at least the decision maker on hiring ) are not in favor of hiring Arabs , Westerns , other nationality 
No skill development only commen sense 
Japanese traditional working culture , calculative , low starting base salary , high turnover rate , equal treatment towards low and top performer , etc 
Maybe it 's German style 
struggling company , no corporate culture , japanese , with unskilled team leader , unethical behaviour tolerated 
They said , `` leaving sony is almost dying '' 
Unable to change 
Loss of local autonomy 
Old-school Japanese company in a few point 
A nice team of qualified and high skilled accountant lost on the very unhealthy environment most of the time avoidable if we had real manager with a proper attitude and approach 
It 's Bangi 
Even if you go overseas for a business/work trip , weekend , night , morning are considered working hour and you are expected to come in the very next working day ! Too many beautiful slide which are not necessary 
No nice coffee ! No healthy food or snack 
Culture here is n't fun at all 
Old way of working Timing Late sitting People Management Politics 
i lost challenging spirit which i had when i wa fresh man 
Lacked leadership for company which had great vision otherwise 
The biggest problem of Sony is that they need to rejuvenate the brand 
The Japanese culture is so focus on hard work that sometimes people feel bad about having a life outside the company 
so that we need to go same time everyday 
Most of the business area lost the Sony spirit 
Declining market , so moral can be low 
80/20 rule always apply in this company 
Working hour are very long with management encouraging even longer hour 
japanese culture hard to learn 
Should improve the Work Culture 
Limitation to align with local requirement 
Working culture is such that long working hour is a norm and expected 
to many people worried about covering their butt 
I get personal space 
creativity is welcome at your own risk but not advised 
I like it so much because it 's a japanese company 
Good work culture , Good environment , 
Nice open work culture but not a very innovative work place 
Good work , work place is good and good collegues 
My peer were wonderful , they have a desire to do well , to help the customer and create a memorable customer experience 
Work culture is overall good 
Work in ericsson on roll , do not opt for off roll position , a person working on off roll position ha to work continuously and ha very le chance of development 
The connection between department give a very good insight into how the company operates Patient , helpful people

good culture

Great Culture 
Feeling of doing something premium , not because it is cheap , but we will do it because it is good for the customer 
Brand SONY , Tough Japanese client 
Very high focus on the people side 
Strong Sony feeling and a lot of history 
Organization is trying to change to be the brand it once wa 
good culture , good work environment , good toward environment , good towards exposure and good change for onsite travel 
Still produce some cool product ( although not best price/quality in the market ) The DNA of the company used to be very good , although it ha lost in term of it culture of respect and honour that ha protected the brand for many year 
Brand strength Global Marketing Base Individual liberty 
Once had leading edge product and the culture wa to be the best of the best in the industry and in customer satisfaction 
able to learn a lot -good a a first job after graduate -very hierarchic , clear definition of workload -management encourage a lot of teamwork and cooperation within the dept and also with other dept , easier to get thing done without escalation of issue ( le political culture ) -if able to perform , management will recognize effort thru non-monetary method 
Prudent , stick to workflow , good after sale service 
nice environment and value of a company with a strong history 
The management is good and employee centric 
Very professional company and good atmosphere to work ; Good facility for employee 
Culture is open and colleague are great to work with 
Employee friendly workplace and policy 
Narrow minded and non compliant 
difficult to integrate the conservative Sony way of working with the Ericsson 
Business were decreasing during my last year in the company which effected the moral and spirit of the company negatively 
If you are afraid to take responsability and make desicions on your own this is not the Company för you 
We are not working a one company , supporting and respecting eachother 
company should maintain it 's brand value 
If you are non-Japanese , you always come second to them 
Too little emphasis on individual capability and freedom of expression 
Sony is company of silo where each individual subsidiary sub optimizes for them self 
Has become very UK-centric over the year which ha impacted the performance and engagement of the local country 
Too many conflict between Swedish and japanese culture 
Managers are either Swedes or Japaneses , so the interaction with manager ha to be adjusted from time to time 
more openness and fairness element should be incorporated in the company culture 
The brand expectation should be met 
I guess that why they shut down the rdu place 
Laid-back -Getting le innovation -Poorer management -Unclear vision and mission 
Lack of transparency and professionalism 
This is a company with democratic in nature , no one care whether you work hard or not 
So they think they are not responsible for their resource 
This created a culture of `` Backroom Managers '' that were unable to effectively sell , coach , or inspire their staff to perform 
They still work on old method and open to new idea 
You can not take even a stationary item ( Stapler , Marker etc 
Even if the employee ha some personal problem to deal with , they wont leave you 
They dnt care about staff 's personal view and plan 
They do n't trust you at all 
My previous company had much better facility and culture 
5 ) Culture is non-cooperative and over work is high expectation with no overtime pay 
6 ) Company do n't believe in keeping employee happy 
Efficiency is not encouraged either , so people need to do a lot of repeated work and attend so many meeting 
Sweden , Central , Legacy , Old platform , Long decissions 
Morale is kept up by touting the company line of reaching annual business plan even though profit goal are reduced yearly 
Strong silo and `` not invented here '' culture 
Management is not machure enough and can not plan long term 
Not speaking Japanese will be a great drawback 
People in sweden need to show some commitment and appreciation of the current situation that the company find itself in 
completely controlled by Japan-side 
not keen on partnering Customers do n't figure in our conversation except a 'things ' to keep at a distance 
Seems somewhat characteristic of Japan however 
Macho management style 
not result or competence

Lot of learning when working with talented electrical and mechanical designer ( not planing , marketing , software designer ) Good brand name 
For a fresher , If u want to prepare for CAT , GMAT , TOEFL this is the best company to do that 
3 ) Firing rate is low a employee themselves leave the company a soon a they get the chance 
Fun and innovative place to work 
Good environment to work in 
It is a big company with many opportunity to do different job , learn different role in a very international and rich environment , with mostly skilled colleague 
Working with Sony Products -Independence and responsibility -A lot of challenge 
Very good company nice environment to work 
Some exciting project to work on , in a wide variety of area across the vast number of category that Sony cover 
i wanted to strat my carrer 
Given lot of chance to learn and travel to numerous place due to job requirement 
Get to work on latest technology and product 
Worst place to work I have ever seen 
sony a a company ha a lot to offer , and work is good 
It 's still a great brand to work for despite it flaw and current struggle 
If you are not ambitious enough , you can get in this company which is quite like a Govt 
Job 
Great benefit , Global presence , ample opportunity for career growth 
good to start your career since we have to find out and create our job by ourselves 
Scope for career progression 
Average starting salary , interesting place to work , learn a lot of thing , encourage creativity/innovation 
Lot of Potential to get good tech 
project from Sony Japan Japanese are workaholic & technically good 
Lot of learning when working with them Interested employee can get 1 year on-site work in Japan Good place for outsourced employee 
You have the chance to work with many product group and flat organization and great working hour 
Great work environment 
You get to work in a truly global company that is fast moving 
Middle Management ha some excellent people who can inspire you in your career 
Lot of focus on training and employee development 
I am not aware of the working of condition at many company , but I think that SONY is not bad a far a chance for learning are concerned 
Very flexible in term of work 
There are a lot of smart people working here 
You would have worlking experience of anouther division/department outside of your specilaity if you wish 
Possible to work from home alot 
A changing working environment/field of work , it never gest boring 
It is a global workplace with lot of opportunity for international travel 
Very interesting technical work with cutting edge product 
too many change for company orgniazation 
internal promotion & assessment is below level 
Lack of experience in some management position 
in it will help for the carrier and job vacancy 
Promotion is extremely limited and is through who you know rather than what you know 
Far too many silo in Sony , Management is inexperienced and no one is ever recruited externally to bring world class talent to the organisation 
More than half of the employee are consultant 
Recruit those few who know theory through 
Working in Japanese 
Bureaucratic working environment 
For fresh graduate from NIT/IIT , it may not prove to be good place to work because u may land in some maintenance or testing project 
bad management nill career growth no stablility in the company 
After 2009 there wa considerable underemployment 
Hiring people from distant country and after 2 month the office closure wa announced 
The Managerial cadre 
Downside being the lack of promotion to move on and make something of myself 
Not an employ friendly organizasion 
No scope of diversified work 
They put a table and chair , it becomes your work place 
Promotions are unheard of 
Not flexible in work from home 
I have worked for more than 2 year a a software engineer in Sisc 
* Cons * Sony Needs a Salary Analyst 
They recruit people from low ranked college , most of them doesnt have enough skill to work in s/w domain 
*1 year of on-job training for a fresher is of no use 
* The company ha no faith on their recruitment 
So , they are not short of application any time 
Unclear strategy Internal promotion process Middle maganagement not always competent Separation in activity / subsidiary 
Organizationally very flat with almost no opportunity for advancement 
Promotions are given out not on merit , but on popularity and exposure 
Sony of Canada offer `` job '' a opposed to `` career '' to potential employee 
Interns are non-paid but the job doe not have to be full time 
Mobility is difficult a far a advancement within the company 
4 ) No facility for employee like other company 
Work here is at Testing , Execution and Maintenance ( TEM ) 
No guarantee for a fresher to which project he will be put into 
10 Months of on-job training literally is of no use 
Very low pay and very slow promotion 
Almost need at least 3 year to be promoted in every level , from general staff to supervisor , than to assistant manager , than to manager , than to senior manager 
So even if you are super excellent , it take you around 10 year to be a manager , which will kill your motivation 
A lot of good experience wa lost in the last downsizing ; many of those people would 've gladly worked together to improve , but the leadership wa too willing to take improper risk with the product to get them launched on time 
No career progression plan for younger employee 
expect you to work blindly until an opportunity is `` given '' to you ( coworker above you quits/laid off ) 
ladder to climb 
dissatisfied management leadership and unfairness of promotion 
It is unfair promotion system 
Lack of HR process Lack of career management Lots of travel Decision making often unclear and lack of process make for a challenging environment to get thing done 
Very limited communication with academia , especially for young researcher 
Be really patient for promotion 
Company is closing door in RTP ; there is no more work to do ; many people have left already ; do n't apply unless you want to go overseas 
Most promotional opportunity are overseas , If you ca n't travel or relocate your advancement opportunity are limited 
The promotion do n't reflect performance 
hard to correct bad salary and hard to advance if not having lot of luck 
Long hour Inflexible Poor leader Japanese get best job , but do n't stay to see thing through Lack of vision Still in denial about ipod Dull office Little development , although improving for some people Very poor at change Do n't see thing through Suspicious of outsider 
Got hired and thrown at a job on your own 
Promotions only based on network contact

No Stock option , Salary is average 
As I mentioned before there are some pro and con , but in this case I will mention only the con ; extremely salary gap between employee within each department , unfavorable condition to minimize excessive expenditure , lack of process to reduced cost or pretty much any thing , lack of head count to support overall company growth and quality a well , and finally like every company there is bureaucracy within Sony Ericsson and change are needed to prosper a a whole
