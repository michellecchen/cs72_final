Was a really fun place to work and I learned a lot from a friendly and supportive management staff 
Sony work culture is great 
For example , my bos 's bos would not accept any complaint about my bos 
Meanwhile my bos would do thing like 
They dont favor married employee 
They expect u to stay back everyday 
Work culture , they work at night 
They dont practice and tolerate with family matter 
Not trying to let people achieve upper position in the company 
Workplace culture suit for me 
The management also keep monitoring and teach u dealing with supplier and customer 
i learnt many thing from this place 
Worked a consutant where consutants were treated like employee 
Good work culture 
starting at Sony wa about solving engineering problem , but that soon changed to be so heavily operation oriented that problem solving wa mostly deploying code , monitoring log , and figuring out how to back it off when failure occurred -- not very challenging or exciting 
`` It is a SONY `` wa the old saying , nowadays this is not enough at all and the competition for success got harder and harder , yet the SONY family manages to stand to their own value and fight inch-by-inch 
They expect 100 % work on work time 
being with in the know how company and also a brand oriented in the market make the door open however it wa not so effective in the last couple of year 
After 10 year of experience in Sony IT department , it would be only fair to say that Sony is like a university where you would experience new technology , global team and great company culture 
Sony doe a great job reaching out into the community through various outreach program , including a successful internship program , from which they acquire and keep top talent that otherwise end up at a startup Get acquainted to the gentle Japanese philosophy , that guide the company to make relevant thing , that move and inspire people , using technology that 's relevant 
Follow proper SDLC 
Always provide challenge to everyone and help them get it done

Learned from the Japanese culture which is they are loyal and prepare to work long hour and le pay 
They have the culture of six sigma and Kaizen , so it help to your own professional improvement 
Having good work culture a well 
the work environment company is very good and people to be proud to the part of the company

Job security is good and so is the culture 
It wa a great learning curve and the management backed the fresher and set a good culture and environment for u to work

I got to work on meaningful project and my co-worker were extremely helpful when I needed help 
The office is laid-back and the manager trust you to manage your own time 
Pretty nice part time job 
Once in the job role the shift hour were undesirable and unflexible 
30am to 7pm every day including every weekend ( when told it would be 1 out of 6 ) 
There is noi life outside if the company a you do not have any time 
Commitment towards work and enthusiasm to learn 
Maintenance , working at dry room , low pressure machine model change quality check Product inspection Management production planning is stressed , messy Machine upgrading is fun due to discus with other engineer and sharing idea 
Workload is very balanced and with competitive compensation 
I had an amazing bunch of co-worker 
The most enjoyable part of SONY wa spending 2 year with a handful of extremely talented and fun people 
On the other hand , if you turn your life and mind over to them in totality , you will probably do well there and have a job for life 
The co-worker are really fun , enthusiastic , helpful and profound with the job 
I especially missed my great colleague there 
Enjoying work with my current Organization

Sony management follow strict deadline for release 
The support from the supervisor and level 2 are very poor

The manager are only concern about their position 
A great company to work for
