I like working here because there are a wide variety of employee from all background with many of the same shared interest 
fun environment ! Most fellow employee were also gamers and we got along really well , but they 're also friendly if you 're not a gamer ! 
Great place to meet new people and unloading trail that come in 
Blizzard 's always been overwhelmingly accepting to all wok of life 
During high turn-over period almost anyone is accepted a long a they have a pulse 
Many friend have been made throughout my 2 year there 
Working in Activision wa very fun due to the diversity of it people , countless language and culture 
From my very first day there I knew I would fit right in 
Satisfaction Dublin is very nice place to work for , with a strong multicultural environment 
The people I worked with were from very diverse background and it wa fun geting to know them a well a work with them and the environment and atmosphere wa a lot of fun at time 
At the personal level , you 're surrounded by people who are kind , helpful , smart , and talented 
Multicultural employee but not upper management 
Getting to know everyone is also alota fun there 
A diverse Marketing Professional with a broad base of Marketing and Project Planning experience spanning consumer promotion , project management , CRM , marketing strategy , advertising , and sale coordination 
[LISTSEP]
If you are a self thinking person and do n't need to fit in , then this is not the place for you 
It 's not what you know , it 's who you know 
It 's a boy club 
Amazing culture , fun loving people 
Culture is nice but benefit are super limited 
Management cared , and that made it easy to want to excel 
It honestly kinda felt like being part of a big awkward family , and not in that stupid corporate PR `` family '' sort of way 
What I learned wa to be very responsible , careful and safety 
Management that really understands family life and are very personable people who treat you more like a person than a number and also help you with typical question one may have when new to video game testing 
Fun place to work , Great business , lot of opportunity , Great management and executive team , Global company , great culture , Entrepreneurship spirit , Fast Pace 
That is how little the company value QA 
QA is where dream and dreamer go to die 
Workplace Culture : Good Hardest Part of the Job : Getting used to the hour , I wa night shift so I had to get used to staying up late 
This job is very team oriented and you are always around other people in a bullpen style office 
The culture wa what you 'd expect ; full of gamers 
Company culture is CYA ( Cover Your *ss ) 
Doing the absolute minimum is what I 've learned working here 
It can be very motivating because the business set goal , stick to it mission and win 
`` Culture can be especially hard for woman 
very few are in leadership role and the company 's value tend to promote combativeness and aggression 
My experience is among bad leadership but this encounter is an isolated situation which doe not reflect the company a a whole 
People were amazed to hear that such high profile company would treat their employee this way 
Employees are very social and kind 
Culture is productive and easy going 
The culture at Activision is one that I dare say could be rarely rivaled ; extremely competent manager who genuinely want the best for each employee 
if you like being treated like cattle , work here 
Colleagues and work culture are most appealing part of the company 
Management know how long a tiresome the process can get and do anything they can to boost moral 
The culture of place wa good 
Company run lean , hard work/long hour is the expectation 
Company culture is work hard , play hard 
I look back at my initial time there a some of the most formative , `` Golden Age '' time of my life 
This is a video game company and the atmosphere match what you 'd expect 
Folks proffered not to speak to one another in fear of hearing it from someone that wa not suppose to repeat it 
The culture of each studio varies , so I would look at each studio to see what fit you 
AP took a subservient approach to managing their dev ops 
Employees were pushed and held accountable 
When you 're on a team were everyone ha the same high expectation of their work , you get so much done that there are no e-mail left and you have to agree to wait your turn for a call 
Strive for excellence in all thing and you 'll succeed 
Everyone is treated a an operator owner in that a long a you get your work done , no one is there to tell you when to arrive/leave/eat/take a break 
I took initiative by stepping up and taking action without being asked 
What I miss the most is the camaraderie I built with my fellow employee 
* Rewarding * Communication , storyboarding * Smart , forward looking , leader , * Fun , family oriented , supportive , collaborative * Short product lifecycles , ever changing industry dynamic * Approved recommendation , special project , the people 
It wa a fast paced workplace , strict on their rule for obvious reason 
There is no time for anything but working , walk in expecting to work and work hard 
Gaming culture is very strong inside the office and you learn a lot about QA process , mostly the localization part 
I leard to just stay calm here and treat people with kindness 
Very what have you done for me lately environment with little loyalty shown to employee 
Ultimately this place will chew you up and spit you out 
Team work is usually essential , and my experience made me learn what 's the best way of doing it ; working together for a higher purpose , a perfect service for the final user , i feel like commitment is one of the most important attribute when the job is a service i 'm giving , the service ha to be the best i can give and i 've always been ready to work harder , overtime and under pressure , and that 's where resiliency come into play ; putting everything i have on a project and be ready to start once again the day after 
I learned patience is a virtue when trying to handle work at a rapid pace , the management at Activision wa superb 
Extremely disrespectful 
I will never come back to this place ever 
Just not worth killing yourself , working , to make someone else rich 
Management and office people seem to look down upon those who actually do the hard work , and are extremely ungrateful 
The people in charge of this company obviously have never heard the term : Never tell somebody to do something you are n't willing to do yourself 
My co-worker all custom cultivated passionate individual who made the place a very inviting place to work 
I learned that giving the customer your full attention will help them feel better about coming to the store and would make them come back 
Management wa always there for support , my co-worker would sometimes ignore their customer but I would step in if they needed help 
Activision Blizzard attracts a fast-paced , typically young workforce who is committed to working hard and collaborating on project 
FUn work place with supportive management and healthy company policy 
Work friendly and employee centric environment 
lack of managment vision and leadership 
If you want to be treated with some kind of dignity and respect , Activision is NOT the place to work 
The one positive thing about the company is the bond you create with your fellow worker 
That reflects the employee experience at lower level 
It 's all about personal relationsips in this company 
The meeting-overloaded culture mean little time to do work , so you are expected to be always-on 
The company promote 'ALL in '' and `` The People '' but I find the staff so unfriendly and stick to who they know 
The Activision work experience is an exercise is cognitive dissonance 
However , it corporate infrastructure and mechanism are beyond bureaucratic and opaque – it culture and ability to adapt to the quickly-changing gaming landscape is nonexistent , and ha been reflected in it market performance a of late 
Environment male dominated and closed-minded 
and if you do n't follow these non-existent process you will get ranted at in an open office 
It is great to see so many co-worker having passion about this company 
The culture of Activision wa awesome and a company where you feel like you belong to something bigger than life 
The player base that you help is very toxic and constantly verbally bash the help you are trying to provide for them 
Lots of gamers around passionate about what they and gaming in general 
They are not very open with employee being themselves at work 
They require a more casual formal dress code , so sorry guy no punk rocker look metal face or heavy tat , least you be fired for being yourself 
They take great care of their employee and give equal part responsibility and deference when it come to handling customer service opportunity 
The culture wa inviting and very warm , even in Activision 's subsidiary 
Being accountable and taking infinitive when needed 
I will show dedication and tremendous effort on any job I had 
The work 's culture wa exemplary and the Music Department specifically wa a highly conducive atmosphere , promoting innovation , productivity and personal job satisfaction 
A reputation for action and building successful positive relationship internally and externally 
Best Teams , Best People , Best Games/Products , Nothing But Love ! : ) 
I love showing my kid 
Activision is a leading video game company and this is shown in the environment people work every day 
It wa a demanding job , but trained me in corporate procedure , professionalism , taking responsibility for your action 
You do establish a loyalty to the company , but not because of Activision itself , but because of your co-worker 
[LISTSEP]
You essentially walk in every day not knowing when you will be allowed to leave 
It ’ s a lot of repetitive work , but the people have been incredible to work with 
So if you ’ re okay with lot of typing and starting at screen and love to do that around fun and energetic like minded people , then I ’ d say this job is for you 
Good enough part time gig 
Time crunching mostly , and the work environment wa very negative to any woman , especially anyone who wa semi attractive at least 
Additionally , there 's a pattern of mass employee exit and ZERO backfill , leaving those left behind to pick up a ton of work , which is n't doable or feasible 
I have made alot of friend during my time working here 
Work load however it 's quite heavy 
Most average work day were pretty nice and i enjoyed them a a member of the night shift 
Everyone got along great and helped each other out , the complaint would be unexpected overtime , a in expected to stay because of emergency test got planned 5 minute before shift ended 
I enjoyed coming to work every day 
Good hour , minimal weekend 
You will not be able to have a life outside of work after the hard pace of the workflow and the demand 
Overall I had a great experience at Activision , the only thing negative about working there is when you work 12 hour shift 
But other than that , the day flew by even during the 10 hour shift 
Half of the staff is also high out of their mind or drunk 
Expect to work weekend and bank holiday 
A typical day at work would be that we were very busy everyday 
The most enjoyable part about this job wa that working with my fellow employee 
typical day of work : help answer ticket and learn more about the Player Support team 
Bad worker are common and not fired nearly fast enough because you still need a crew to sail your ship even if the majority of them are useless 
QA testing at Activision involves some video game playing but mostly involves searching and writing bug a well a marking off testing in list and verifying bug fix 
This job requires a lot of flexibility a communication from other office can be sparse and unclear which can lead to a lot of waiting to be able to do thing 
I have met a lot of really good people doing this job , some of which are the best coworkers I 've ever had , but that doe n't make up for the daily frustration of this job 
We had been on crunch for 4 month ( 12hr day 6 day a week ) and that wore everyone down substantially and eliminates any healthy work/home balance 
I loved working for this company the work wa consistent never a time when you did not have something to do fast paste is my joy it make the time fly by the only thing I wished for wa overtime 
Depending on your project , you will find yourself working 12 hour a day , 6 day a week , for week or month prior to launch 
Company , in general , is a fun work environment with like-minded worker 
Working QA doe not give the employee much notice , if any , for if work will be required on weekend 
If you do not have much else to do and would love to work with a fun group of people on fun project then this is not bad 
However if you have other thing to do outside of work , it get in the way of personal development 
Typical Day at Work : You worked on finding bug and glitch most of the day 
When you were feeling like you needed a break it wa time for a break 
What I learned : It 's enjoyable to work a a Q & A Tester Management : Good overall , only negative wa did n't really have flexible scheduling 
Lots of 100 hour week to finish a game , but if you love the gaming it is worth all of the sacrifice in your personal life 
Working at Activision Blizzard 's Austin campus wa a great experience , the atmosphere wa like being with a family 
You 'll face a many un-fun contact a the run of the mill every day contact ; great and impressionable contact can be far and few between 
A typical work day is 8:30am to 5:30pm or 5:30pm to 2:30am for night shift , Monday to Friday with varying weekend work 
The work environment is very friendly and casual but professional with a focus on the current project 
Overall , if you are someone that ha a lot of time to work , you enjoy gaming and working with people with the same passion a you to help make them work , then this is the place for you 
69 hour of committed time per week for over month 
From my experience working at the Activision QA MN branch , I have had a lot of fun a well a experienced a lot of adversity 
It is a fun place to work out but also will keep worker occupied 
There is plenty of downtime but also plenty of time where everyone is working constantly 
The hardest part of this job is during crunch time , you eat sleep and test the game which make work/life balance difficult if you 're a family man/woman 
Yes , you will be working every weekend from now until Ragnarok 
I ca n't tell you the number of people that have quit because they did n't want to work the weekend 
Many of the people that work here play too many game and do n't 
It wa fun at time and easy at time wa really fast paced under staft management wa poor unfair treatment depending on nationality lead did very little to help worker lead were always right according to management supervisor alike 
Prior to all release and launch , most employee will end up working 12+ hour per day up to 7 day per week , not allowing much time outside of work 
However , that being said , most of the staff is very nice and friendly to be around for these long hour 
I can not really review Activision because it ha been so long since I have been there and the company ha changed so much over the last 20 year 
Collaboration and interaction is somewhat low and work is a lot slower than a traditional production company a much is being developed in-house 
The hardest part of the job wa going back home at the end of the summer 
a good place for a summer job , but wont be able to support long term financial responsibility 
but with the right crew any fun 
Typical day at work walking in to work everyone smiling an talking an getting settled in 
you may get a little ditsy but The most enjoyable part wa coming into work feeling blessed to have a job an me an my co-worker motivating each other to be there every day 
There were slow day and busy day 
Ther work hard and party harder 
it a lot of work and very high competition for position but they make you feel like your part of something and it more like hanging out with friend than dealing with coworkers 
The most enjoyed part of the day wa specking with my co worker 
The work culture is great and there is a decent work/life balance 
there are ton of fun opportunity while at work and a party on every game release 
I found my time at Activision to be a mixed bag 
I worked with quality people and I enjoyed coming to work each day 
Eventually , it became to much stress for not enough pay , and I wa literally sleeping under my desk and working for work on end consecutively on a regularly basis 
To put it simply , Activision 's QA office is simply nothing more then a grinder 
The employee were wonderful to work with , but management would throw a wrench in the work daily 
I enjoyed working there , but at time it felt very fast paced and it wa extremely hot in there 
As a huge gamer , ironically I 've never had such little free time to play game since working at Activision 
Most day would be spent answering call and e-mail sent by customer needing help 
When there were neither call nor e-mail , we could enjoy a few minute playing any game the company made 
The workplace wa enjoyable 
If even one person decides to be a slacker , it can slow everything down to a crawl 
Unless you are a gamer or desperate for any work , do not even think about working here ! Very high turnover , back-stubbing and on-going threat of layoff create a very toxic work environment 
The only hard part wa meeting the daily bug count towards the end of the project because there were not many left 
Great place to work , very busy , allowed you to work on your own 
But there is also pressure to get work done a fast a possible 
*Learnt a lot both in term of IT Management and Technical *Became an expert Oracle Apps DBA *Implemented EBS in 3 different country *Managed a larger IT staff from different faculty *Was very respected a both Technical and Leadership candidate *Great culture overall *Very tight and close IT -very tight IT shop with very little resource -lot more work than resource -Huge work-life balance impact -Some executive management decision were not good 
The coworkers , a well a the environment , offered a workspace that wa energetic , enjoyable , and a very positive work environment 
only one shift per day 
everyone get the same break time 
The time of the day is free , do a you please a long a you finish a reasonable amount of work 
The hardest part wa getting through the 12 hour a day 7 day a week , but your co-worker are there to push your through the day 
You go in a co-worker , but leave the project a a family 
Typical day wa log in , take ticket , log into web-chat , take LOTS of ticket , log into phone , take call 
Lunch Back on to the queue , take more ticket 
Go home 
The work can be challenging at time , and repetitive at others 
Work usually run from 9 AM to 5 AM during winter and early spring 
Days are usually long and stressful 
The beginning of the day consists of me reviewing over my email from developer , production , management and outsource QA 
I 've learned to manage my work a well a my tester and be able to prioritize the importance of what issue need to be addressed first a opposed to le sever issue 
Testers and fellow QA Leads were all a pleasure to work with 
Work hour and overtime are frequent while approaching deadline and employer are asked to be flexible to work on weekend when needed 
Fun place to work 
~Making sure you do n't fall behind because you well hold up the line 
I always went to work smiling 
It wa great getting home with story to tell 
I wa dedicated in working long hour to get the project done and it wa well worth it to see the final thing 
Everyone work hard and make sure that you get the work done and achieve what they ask of you 
It is a typical American style base in Shanghai with casual but effective working environment 
mostly hire temp staff and no benefit and work -life balance 
The co worker are awesome , management really test you and brings out the best in you 
Fun work environment with personal benefit 
Typical work day would include productivity , meaning not very much time to stand around 
The most enjoyable part of my time working at Activision would have to be the people and the environment , everyone wa such a pleasure to be around 
The only good thing that I got out of this job , wa making friend with the people I directly worked with on a daily basis 
The most enjoyable part wa working with all the new game that came out and also the other co-worker 
This job required a lot of my time and school did n't really work with my schedule , looked for something more part time and ended up leaving 
we loaded and unloaded video game for shipping to store and it wa a team environment and i like working there it just wa n't stable 
It 's a fun and productive work place 
Was a good day always went to work and thats what i did got the day started with an energy drink and a bit a tune and i wa ready to go 
leaRNED HOW TO DO EVERYTHING I HAD TO DO AS IN THE CLEANING FORKLIFTING STOCKING PACKING IT WAS simple management wa good had u on top co worker did there part worked hard for what we need and that wa money hardest part wa leaving work do to so much thrive i had gotten couldnt rerst after being on a roll and the best part wa break got to recharge by taking a trip to the store and grab a drink 
family business personal assistant team player flexible schedule 
I made good friend , worked on good game and they did n't demand a lot of overtime due to having a day shift and a night shift 
tested game entered bug information into a database it wa 40+ hour and I worked the night shift so I had a fair share of long night 
depending on the area your working you can have very to learn thing extremely quickly to `` swim without sinking '' 
A typical day would be helping customer to my full potential , to satisfy their need so they can be a happy customer when they leave 
The hardest part of the job wa trying to keep up with so many customer , the most enjoyable part of my job wa seeing the customer very happy and then I would see them back the next day 
However , due to the large number of title released every year and the relatively small number of people , work day were long and frequently worked on the weekend 
I enjoy what I do a a QA and CS rep for this company , but I had difficulty feeling like the company actually cared about the work I did for it 
My typical day at work is to check my daily assignment , have a meeting , find the best way to complete the task with the co-worker , depending on the project 
Feels like a family here , people help you when you need it , and it 's real fun to work for 
As soon a I started , no one talk to you , everyone there is soo busy and focused there is no time for laugh or play 
Most enjoyable is working a a team and having a set schedule 
The job itself wa compelling enough to keep me interested in what I wa testing , but the 80 hour work week got old fast 
Fun environment to work in 
working at the place is really fun and my teammate are great and supportive 
However you should prepare yourself for zero work life balance a you will be doing a ton of overtime , including many time where you will be working 12-14 hour a day for 9-14 day in a row and it can sometimes ramp up to up to 18 hour a day , all without any warning 
The schedule varies a lot , but be prepared to work 50 hour regularly , a well a up to 75+ hour during crunch time ( the last title averaged around 65 hours/week in the month leading up to it release ) 
Overall though , I 'd recommend it if the overtime is something you can handle 
Management is good and supportive , fun work environment 
The hour are long but that 's great for someone who love to work 
What i learned is that it wasnt my dream job after all however it wa still alot of fun and would deffinately do it all again if i could that and i had also learned many other thing there too such a writing detailed report but not too detailed and how to edit screenshots and video but also how to use a searching tool called Jira 
The atmosphere working there wa not at all what i expected but wa much more then i could have hoped for too 
You are constantly reminded that you are a contract employee with an expiration date 
There is zero work-life balance 
We have been working six day a week , eight to twelve hour a day since August of 2020 
At the very least you ’ ll be working 6 day a week , this get even worse during crunch 
Don ’ t expect much of a social life you are married to the company , oh and a far a advancing in the company go it ’ s very unlikely regardless of how hard you work 
They just wanted the work to be done and in return you had freedom 
You schedule is not your own 
Everything is steady until crunch time and the hour grow longer 
Casual and friendly work environment 
Long and unpredictable hour , especially during the holiday season 
Activision is an industry leader with tremendous IP , strong leadership , great work-life balance , and a great culture 
Was a videogame company and our job a videogame tester wa to find problem or bug in our relative language and of curse have fun aswell , really good people workig here 
Activision aspires to be an innovative , leading company and while many people there are working extremely hard to make that happen , leadership is n't fully aligned and the day-to-day is taxing 
Most people are given the freedom to work remotely a needed , and be off-site to look-after kid , but it 's really case-to-case and overall the culture doe n't seem to have kept up with the fact that the longer-tenured employee are now married with kid and need a more realistic balance 
Had a good time doing my work with them 
Activison strives for a balance of demanding work while balancing it with a relaxed atmosphere 
seriously we could n't even use the canteen after work to play board game once a week 
Everyone in the office is nice and the environment is also very nice 
Fun and relaxed a well a fast passed when crunch time come 
Long hour , but it is so worth it ! I highly recommend working here ! For example , lot of party 
When team wa small , people worked together with fun 
Passionate people working on great game 
Flexible hour , casual dress and amazing work gathering kept me coming in excited for work every day 
Coworkers were also a blast we would play ping pong on every break and we truly enjoyed playing the game 
Hardest part of the job wa not able to play more even thought 90 % of the time we were playing 
Provides freedom to manage project etc while supporting a creative work culture 
Get to work 10 minute before 9am 
Check email and listen to voicemail 
Very Friendly workspace with Leads who help support the QA tester 
Make sure tester are getting quality work done to assure the game exceeds it expectation 
Adjusting to the speed of progress and schedule 
Breaking when you need to 
relaxing work environment while QA testing company product 
also nice/fun co-worker 
I heard about another tester who also had phenomenal number , but after FOUR YEARS of being a perma-temp he just burned out on the job , let his number slip , and wa let go 
It wa fun to work here and test game 
A typical day at Activision would consist of me testing video game and learning how to capture new bug or problem in the software 
Test game , write up bug , submit bug 
But with schedule a the same wa just horrifying 
And lunch hour all at the same time 
We were trated a if we were robot programmed to take break all at once 
You were only able to go to the bathroom on the break and if you had to go , you needed permission from your QA lead who looked like he wa still going to high school 
Get to my work station 
The management wa awesome a well a the co-worker I have made life long friend 
5pm and that wa it 
The management and my fellow employee were such a joy to be around and although we had a lot of fun we also got a lot done in term of testing 
A typical day consisted of analyzing game prior to release and ensuring each bug wa being tracked in a database for the game developer to review 
Although the company did not have the stability I would have hoped for , I realize this is common in the gaming industry 
My time at Activision wa enjoyable and they provided a fun environment a well a a comfortable break area ; it 's hard to frown in a room with a ping pong table 
Hours are long and tiresome but it 's fun being able to work on videogames all day 
This environment requires multitasking , diplomacy , and crisis management 
The hardest part of the job wa keeping all of my 'hats ' straight 
The most enjoyable part of my job wa being on the Rec Committee , setting up event such a Ice Cream Day , buying swag for the Company Store , Birthdays , etc 
[LISTSEP]
Oh our boss get reamed out when a critical showstopper is missed , who then in turn ream u out a a group , but catch something egregious just before a major game expo 
For a studio spun-off from a gaming company it a surprisingly non-gamer community ; like most production company ABS is a small unit on no-nonsense executive and their assistant 
Upper management only care about the number 
Only one aspect of the project is noted by upper management , but many part are required to deliver a finished product 
Direct manager are at least competent 
Management is great , the senior tester are on the floor with QA tester to help with any issue , the lead try to help you with a much a they can and give out task to do for the day 
Head manager also try to keep everyone posted about any event or change to anything 
I would still approve of the CEO because he doe make smart business decision , I just think he doe n't know or care about how his lower employee are treated 
Management philosophy is also very Republican and most of the top brass are big GOPers 
Later that day , I see him on his phone , which since he 's a supervisor , he 's allowed to have , but here 's the kick , he wa on Facebook 
Great Company , Great Leadership but no synergy between the top and mid-level management 
Scheduled and coordinated meeting , appointment , and other similar activity for supervisor , which also included travel arrangement 
[LISTSEP]
I wa excited to start working in the gaming industry 
I made some friend , I learned some thing , but the job , to me , wa generally torture 
you can not afford to work at Blizzard 
If you are NOT a developer/designer directly making product , you are a step child and expendable 
It 's an amazing job until your contract end 
As one of the first place to work once you arrive in Ireland , Activision is a good place to get started 
Its a contract job for people with dream of game development 
As an easily replaceable quality assurance tester in the gaming industry , you will never be left wondering about your job security 
This is not where your dream of becoming a videogame developer will begin 
Working QA at Activision wa n't like any other job that I had worked at or have worked at since 
Career growth is non existant , they pretend like everyone ha a chance when it 's really all about those already permanent 
A fun company to grow with and be a part of 
all in all a great company to work for 
There are sign at retail position in my area for $ 14 
Do n't come here thinking this is your `` foot-in-the-door '' like some many naive kid I see 
You will never get out of QA 
The CEO or some executive will never come over and see you doodling during your break and be so impressed by your subpar weeb drawing that you are elevated to a character artist 
You could make lead , or project lead maybe 
But the company ha routinely laid off large group of QA position when profit did n't meet their unrealistic expectation 
It 's an office job involving video game more than a job about playing video game 
What 's more is , because our testing office is nearly constantly hiring , newer people always outnumber people who have been here a while 
There are some opportunity for advancement , but for the average tester , there is no hope of moving up even if you do a lot of the work people above you do already 
A great company to work for in an amazing dynamic industry with tremendous potential 
If you want to move up in the community 
Working at Activision ha to be the focus of your life 
Contracted position ensure that you never have job security and that you are expendable regardless of performance 
Working for a video game company ; a Customer Service , you do interact with an interesting customer base 
When choosing the Austin campus , if you 're wanting to work your way up the chain to non-Customer Service job 
Being so secluded from Head Quarters , networking can be a major challenge 
Do n't see Customer Service a 'getting your foot in the door ' 
Entry level position are all contract based , and with most contract , temporary 
Advancement opportunity is severely limited 
The hourly rate is very low a with most entry level job , which is understandable 
Temporary and used for experience 
As it is a contract job , I have met a lot of new and interesting people who have come through the job 
Direct management is always within reach a they are on the testing floor near the other tester at all time 
Seasonal job to start and no experience needed to start 
Great coworkers and it 's definitely a place I would stay long term if there wa career advancement built into the role 
Activision is like business school on steroid 
My time a a Summer intern at Activision/Blizzard wa an incredible experience 
The most rewarding part of working at Activision ha been the plethora of opportunity to grow my skill a a concise writer a well a bolstering my ability to efficiently grasp make quick decision in heated time 
They do not take that into consideration when it come to compensation for working there 
Permanent position are rare and hard to come by 
seen hard worker there for 10+ year and never got a promotion or raise 
it wa great working a a production line 
also working a a sit down forklift driver and working at distribution worker at Blizzard 
a a order picker and rf scanner 
If you want to get an MBA-level education without spending the money , working there give you a ton of cool opportunity to learn 
One of the best company to work with , there are ample amount of scope to advance in your career growth 
Working for the game industry give you a wonderful bit of insight into how it work 
It is also a very 'ebb and flow ' business model so job security can be scary 
Working at Activision Blizzard wa a blast 
In general it ’ s a pretty good place to work 
Fun company to work for 
Activision is a ton of fun to work for 
It can be a reward place to work if you are ambitious and willing to sacrifice a lot for the job 
However , there is no room for advancement and you will barely see life outside of work 
Blizzard is a company I could see myself working for my whole life , but only if I wa able to find a better type of job within the company a well a better pay 
I wa a customer service representative 
You 'd only be able to earn a decent salary if you managed to work your way up the ladder to a senior or management role , but you 'd have to compete with a lot of other people to do so 
There are other department available , but many of them require the best of the best 
You can expect extremely limited job advancement a there are only a handful of full time job available and they typically only go to those who have developed an 'in ' with the management team 
This is a job for those in a transitional period of employment 
If you 're on the right side with HR , you 'll get ahead 
It 's hard to advance if you 're on the corporate side 
The studio development side is different and there is more room for advancement 
It wa a good job 
It wa full of `` career-minded '' people that were highly inspired and mostly fun to work with 
Also , the internship never grew in a paying job 
When I would interview for a position , I would , instead , be offered another chance at the internship 
I worked at a warehouse and a there temporary employee I wa assigned to do the following : putting label on box , stacking the box on pallet , receiving shipment , organizing the merchandise , put the merchandise back in to a box , and get the box ready to ship out 
This job wa awesome because you get to play video game for a job 
Great environment to work in 
Be aware that some position are contract based 
Do not expect to be hired permanently for those position 
I learned a great deal during my time at Activision and I hope to work with them again 
After working for Activision Blizzard for ten year , I learned that I could work anywhere 
Working at Activision ha offered numerous opportunity for growth and development , whether that be mental , emotional , internal , or educational 
The downside of working in Activision is that it is absolutely impossible to advance in this company , a all contract are temporary only 
Regardless of how much work an individual put in , it all come down to the bias opinion of the manager whether you are worth keeping around or not 
Job wa contract based for a short term project 
great place to work 
I dedicated a lot of my time working at Blizzard , it is a fantastic company to work for 
A great work environment , with a lot of highly skilled individual who are looking to make an impact in the industry ! 
All in all , a great place to work 
If you like a fast pace and hot working environment then this is n't such a bad place to work at 
Management is n't all that great 
Activision is an amazing company to work for 
I have learned enough from this company to become a strong warehouse worker that I see myself being 
Here you can meet a lot of people freshly arrived in Dublin and looking for first work experience 
At first , didn´t like video game but because of the job , I love them 
i learned alot about prodution line work there and about the video game industry 
Activision Blizzard wa an amazing environment to work in and i got a lot of experience in QA Testing and Bug writing 
This job is not for everyone a the workweek can exceed 80 hour per week and pay is hourly but if you have a passion for video game this can be a great introduction 
I took a job here a a tester to get my foot in the door after moving to California and previously working a an assistant producer at another game studio 
Once hired you are only looked up a your position and previous work experience mean nothing 
The quality assurance tester are the lowest of the low and were referred to a the monster in the basement 
Moving up or getting hired on full time felt like complete luck and the vast majority of quality assurance tester were kept a temp employee for year non stop 
My goal after working here wa to move up in the industry till I wa an executive , because I wanted to change the industry for the better and treat all my employee fairly and with respect 
Free game ! Exciting work event 
Great place to work 
Great manager who really care about your growth 
It is a fun place to work and express my talent 
Very fast paced environment for work 
If you want to work in the big time of gaming and pull off some amazingly cool project it can be done here if you work for it 
Lots of resource all around you to do great work 
I needed to be a politician and an internal propagandist to get thing done , because so many people need to be brought into the loop to approve any one project 
Great job , room to grow if you are willing to put the time in 
Most of my professional experience is based on my 7 month job a a QA tester for Activision Dublin , where i learned and developed good skill in the QA department and where i wa able to discover my best attribute in a work environment 
As a QA tester i learned everything about the QA process and developed skill in some of the most important software in the videogame industry ( Jira , for example ) , i also worked on franchise which are among the top tier in the industry , like Call of Duty ( and it 's last incarnation : Advanced Warfare ) and Skylanders 
I worked in Distribution , which is literally the hardest work you could do at the company 
I hope they find better job a well a myself 
I also got forklift certified , but it conveniently only applies towards their company 
Selling car wa a new experience for me , something I never thought I would see myself doing 
I loved the job , and I regret leaving , but at the time I thought I wa going to be able to go back to school and finish my degree 
Its a good Organization to work with to have challenging work and Career Growth 
I like working at Activision Blizzard 
This company is through Placement Pro Temporary Agency 
I work there not too long and got lay off 
If they ever need me to go back work there , i diffidently will go back to work for them 
it can be a fun place to work esp 
management doe not exemplify great value and very little in way of career advancement/development 
I really liked working at Activision for the time that I wa there 
I also felt like I could advance in the company if given the chance 
I learned how to work on a production line , my line leader and supervisers were great always helped if something wa wrong 
very organized company , with a lot of benefit and opportunity to grow in the industry 
The management and co-worker were great , but almost all of the job are temporary 
It wa great to work on industry-leading title such a World of Warcraft and Call of Duty 
I felt better working for the CS department 
Great mentor to learn from and develop a career path within the NWA vendor community 
Accomplishing order , stocking , manufacturing product 
Great group of customer support rep 
Aside from the numerous issue brought to light in recent month , there is little room for progression and few employee who work full-time 
The company ha an extremely high turnover rate 
This is definitely the most enjoyable job I 've had , the work itself is quite fun if you enjoy video game and have an eye for detail 
You work for either Tapfin or Volt under Activision 
I definitely hope to work more with them in the future 
As a QA tester you are constantly told how important you are to the development of game like Call of Duty 
Sadly you should expect frequent turnover 
The contract/temporary worker situation is annoying and take away from the experience of working at a cool company like activision 
An exciting industry to work in with many sharp , creative and friendly people but one that exploit the graphic artist , programmer and quality assurance personnel with low pay , long hour and low job security because there is a constant supply of entry-level replacement seeking hire 
Is the best company to work for because they had the best game like call of duty I forgot what they have the best game I really loved working for this company so I would really love I mean love working here 
Great place to work but might not be a great place to grow 
5am AS OF TOMORROW ! ! '' and if you do n't like it FIND ANOTHER JOB 
Dynamic work environment in a fast moving industry 
It doe n't matter how talented , skilled and intelligent you are in the specific expertise you are passionate for 
Excluding the few elite , the average tenure at Activision is about 1 
Do n't waste valuable year of your career at that place 
95 % never get promoted 
Career pathing is non-existent and when organization shift occur there is little to no thought put into rolling them out to employee 
Job demand a person with a eye for detail Tester is required to submit all bug and glitch to a database and hand written report to product lead 
I worked a a freelancer for Activision so I had little interaction time at the office studio 
I hope to one day work for Blizzard 
I worked in the basement with the Graphics Department 
Nonetheless , great job , great coworkers , and great leader 
None of the perk of working in a real game company office 
NO job security or room for advancement 
There ’ s a clique in management like in High School 
If you don ’ t agree with them or god forbid form your own opinio , you ’ re out of a job real soon 
Great company to get experience 
I wish they would provide more employee development and expansion opportunity 
This is a contract job and you are not an Activision employee so your chance of building a path that lead to a career with the company is not that high 
While I love video game and being surrounded by them on a daily basis , this is not the ideal area of the industry I 'd like to be in 
great place and I am glad to work a a intern at there 
Great people and a great job 
This wa a very interesting job because I wa constantly surrounded by other gamers 
If you are a gamer this would be a very fun volunteer job to do 
Professional and well qualified colleague , know what the are doing and trying to excel 
Great place to work 
I wa with Activision a a junior tester for work experience in Transition Year 
My job entailed playing through pre-production video game , and noting down any bugs/text mistake that occurred so they could be rectified 
Activision is a great company to work , providing opportunity to add value to the business , take full ownership and responsibility for your role , with great scope to develop and improve existing practice , process and initiative 
Activision is a pretty amazing place to work 
Amazing place to work 
IF they had n't shut down my business unit I would have been a lifer 
Activision is a great company to work for 
Would have worked for again had I not moved to Oregon 
I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to visit Blizzard 's campus a part of my intern program 
Activision EP , MN is a great place work management is great 
Unfortunetly they work on a contract basis only which make them lose many good tester , and when it come to advancing up the rank they are not good about making great choice about whom they chose 
Working here ha taught me so much about myself and that I am capable of almost anything in a corporate or warehouse environment 
During the Guitar Hero day I had the pleasure of working in the Activision ( now Activision | Blizzard ) Music Department 
Sure , we all know there 's no job security when you work QA , but looking around the office , I saw maybe 3 people who were in their late 30 and early 40 
The odds of you making in this company is basically nil 
They wave the possibility of getting hired in your face , but it never happens 
One QA Tester wa finding 30 bug a day , they *still* never hired him 
Essentially he wa a perma-temp , constantly being re-hired for the next project 
Even worse , I heard about a guy who worked management , but still wa n't an actual employee , he wa a contract employee , he worked there a management for two year 
He wa finally hired on a full-time employee , then wa let go two month later 
Make no mistake , Activision doe not give a darn about you , you have no chance of making it here , and if you 're one of the lucky few hired back in the 80 , you have no chance 
Activision is a great starting off poing in the field of quality assurance , however it 's also where you learn about how tough life can be when you are trying to move up 
I learned about the game dev cycle 
Company could be better by giving more project to QA Tester 's , normally they lay off QA Tester 's after one project wa finished when I wa working there 
Its not bad for a 1st job , it wa a good job to grow in but not to move up in 
Very rare chance that you will ever become an Activision employee 
This wa the greatest job in the world in my eye 
However because it wa an easy job to hire for , most people got fired from the company 
Activision Publishing wa my foot in the door into the gaming industry 
It 's a fun job that is definitely a job 
Job security is always completely up in the air 
If you want to jump into the trench warfare of developing for such franchise like Call of Duty , this is the place to work 
I consider Activision to be my first REAL job 
I held several position over my seven-year stint there , and loved each one of them 
I filled many different need while employed there , a I handled all employee entrance/exits ; security ; supply and facility management ; a well a holding the position of Recreation Committee Chairperson 
While working at Activision , I survived several layoff 
The problem is that during those layoff , the position name were changed and filled 
It wa really tough to move up in the organization since they did a lot of outside hiring and very little in house promoting 
Many of the people who were in house and already doing the job , but not having the title were turned down for the position due to `` lack of experience '' causing morale to dip and some employee to look for better position elsewhere 
Do n't get me wrong , some people do move up , but it is few and far between for those that do 
[LISTSEP]
But i do recommend to all that are so passionate and hard worker that are experienced at what they do work smarter not harder the pay wasnt good for me but i enjoyed working there i can only imagine what my pay would look like if i got payed more by the hr 
Not compensated well , Largely forgotten about , communication isnt good among the team 
You do the work of a level way above you only to get paid penny for what you 're achieving 
There is also a culture of lower employee being overworked and promised certain benefit ( pay raises/promotions/etc ) only to find themselves doing the work and two year later , not getting what they were promised 
The pay is below industry standard and far below the area cost of living 
Blizzard feel that it is such a priviledge to work at Blizzard that they can pay far below the gaming industry average salary for any and all position at all level 
The pay is so far below the area cost of living that everyone who work at Blizzard is basically destitute , and that is considering the 80 hour work week with 16-20 hour 7 day a week especially during crunch time before game update release date 
The benefit are not worth the extra cost you have to pay in for 
Developers are well taken care of 
Lack of advancement , way to much overtime demanded , pay is a joke , always be a contractor not a full time employee , full time employee will physical abuse you 
You 'd need to work overtime all the time but never get paid for itDo not believe what they say in the hiring processThey do not reimburse expense for devicesTerrible management 
Several perk , including free game 
It take advantage of people by giving them expensive insurance and poor wage 
They justify low pay by giving their employee merchandise 
And not high enough pay for the stress , and not enough to even pay rent 
Plus you get paid time and a half during overtime 
The only real problem that I had with the job were thing like : you might not be making enough to make the job worth your while unless you are taking the absurd overtime hour , the majority of position above your manager will treat you like dirt and only barely allot your manager any respect at that , and that the QA position is considered seasonal but they do n't tell you when your last day is so you just end up wondering when your job is going to end instead of being able to plan around it 
The salary is really low for a city like Dublin , contract are temporary , max 18months 
awesome kitchen : free snack and drink ! 
The pay is terrible 
5 billion dollar in 2018 and just recently increased tester salary to a whole $ 12 an hour 
Metrics are the name of the game yet QA employee are not rewarded for meeting mile stone with number of bug submitted 
Pat on the head and a `` good job '' Developers talk down to u in comment , insult our intelligence , and treat u a a nessecary evil 
Good worker are rewarded with more responsibility for no extra pay 
Overtime pay is nice , but the base pay leaf much to be desired 
If you 're expecting your hard work to ever be rewarded stay far away 
The hardest part for me personally wa the crunch time hour in which the hour were increased dramatically but the overtime pay wa well worth it 
So , someone who performs to the best of their ability is always going to be paid the same a someone who performs the bare minimum 
The company relies too heavily on metric and unrealistic target prediction to make sure it 's getting it money 's worth 
You are contract and thus will NEVER get a raise 
Good employee are rewarded with more work and responsibility for the same wage 
The company doe attempt to acknowledge success and offer reward to lower-level employee who are outperforming expectation but the company could do better 
everyone get video game console and TVs on their desk , there are free snack , and the company doe lot of happy hour and party 
40 hour a week with minimum wage 
The job is easy and you 're paid to game all day 
treated like a dime a dozen 
Not the greatest pay to start but lot of available overtime to make up for it 
free food frequently , and lot of promotional product for game a they come out , movie screening , and plenty of casual hang out time to relax 
Being able to play video game from time to time wa great 
The free snack and drink wa okay too 
Slightly above average compensation , benefit 
Perks make up the difference 
The only two thing that drove me away are the pay and the type of work I wa doing 
The pay wa also fairly typical for customer service 
They require degree 's for their minimal QA role and then pay on a scale of someone with no educational experience 
They also gave you water bottle because of how hot it wa 
The pay wa n't so good but the hour were 
Us in the trench had to skip the fun or try to get one of our finance buddy to grab u a free t-shirt or ice cream that wa being handed out for no particular reason 
The benefit you get are worth doing your best while working here 
Great job good pay , long hour with alot of break , great enviroment , sad that it is only temporary 
They provided great food for free for whoever worked on the weekend 
Immediately had to start 12 hour shift , 6 day a week after hiring , overtime pay included 
Being able to purchase game discounted is a plus Met wonderful lifelong friend Group environment is a great at making someone a team player 
Great benefit and bonus company 's culture is key to it 's success 
Only a temporary job but we got a ton of hour ! that wa a huge plus ! if I wa n't getting over 40 hour I probably would n't have stayed because there wa a lot of different type of people but also gang member with tattoo so there wa a lot of word exchanged and dirty look all day long 
Great place to work ! Benefit package is great , and the coworkers are awesome 
Everyday I wa there , I wa smiling the whole time , alot of perk , long break , and awesome hour 
Pay is good , but the healthcare plan , 401K are not up to par 
Bonus plan are very unfair depending on what section of the business you work in 
A typical warehouse job 
I really enjoyed working at Activision , but the pay is not really enough , the hour can be extreme during crunch time , and there is little room for advancement 
The pay though wa not worth the what it cost to live in California which why I had to quit and move back to Texas 
I get paid a fair amount and the free lunch and dinner are great I just do n't like how easily we can be replaced 
People in Activision are great , everyone is willing to help each other and we often have so much fun , but when it come to pay and benefit we are very underpaid for the very technical job we do and contract are only fix term 6 month 
guess if you like video game it ’ s cool , just feel like game tester should get better pay 
You 're not an Activision employee a a QA tester and you get none of their benefit 
No paid time off , though you can request time off 
The most Enjoyable part of the job were that i wa getting to help create something very special for the entire world to see a a pasionate gamer myself i wanted whatever they had u working on to be nothing le then perfect in every sense of the word , also it wa awesome that they had let u eat and drink at our desk which helped me out hugely due to the fact that i have a hyper active thyroid which make it so that im constently hungry so i need to eat more often then others , also another 
Meanwhile you recieve a W2 
During training and orientation you sit in on all of these call where Activision tell you about these amazing benefit 
When the call end you are told `` Those benefit are for permanent employee in California '' 
When you first sign on to the position you are informed and forced to sign a contract that state you are not eligible for a bonus regardless of the game sale or performance 
While it easy to ask for time off , you are not eligible for PTO because you are not considered a permanent employee 
Best Job Ever ! I got to work at any time during office hour 
Pros 
and post-release 
Low compensation 
The entire reward and recognition system is based on favoritism 
Overworked , underpaid , temporary contract , zero benefit 
Salary is lower than McDonalds for doing quality assurance , seriously 
Yet , the compensation is n't worth it , in a monetary sense 
Granted there are a bunch of random perk , also there are long 14 hour day 
Pay rise is a joke £200 per year ! 
The only perk ? Decent coffee ( when the machine work ) If you have any history working in the game industry at all you know that part of the 'payment ' for long hour and substandard payrates are the perk ( snack , game night at the very least ) Activision Dublin 
The program used for Bonus structure take too long , and it can be hard to really gauge your success 
Lots of perk 
Small team , good benefit with bonus and company share 
Lots of great perk including game 
Because thats what we are paid to do is trying to catch a many error a we can 
They also take really good care of their employee 
Access to the latest title of game and older version of game 
Very rewarding and positive experience 
Filed report and managed return on defective or broken equipment and/or disc 
Still a QA tester position make $ 10 and hour , and a long a you 're realistic about what the job offer , it 's fine 
Good hour and overtime also 
I went to work and played video game for 8-12 hour a day and got paid for it
