Even a a non-gamer I still felt welcome , but it is an especially fun place for gamers 
No dress code , even you can come in short with slipper Cons : 
Veg at 20 rupee and non veg-25 
People across the different department were always willing to help each other 
If you 're not a geeky , white , and socially awkward do n't even apply 
People across the different department were always willing to help each other 
the location is quite ideal with food and entertainment being in a very lively neighborhood 
I have made allot of friend , we where like a family 
I got the chance to meet a lot of people from different area around the world and it wa pretty funny to meet so many different culture in 1 area 
Everyone is very welcoming

Toxic culture 
High turnover ( everyone is leaving ) It 's a horrible place to work and their culture of institutional harassment is very real and very bad 
Stay away ! 
The cat came out of the bag last year when multiple outlet wrote revealing piece about what a toxic workplace Ubisoft is 
And I am absolutely convinced that Ubisoft will never change it way 
If they take any step it will be to salvage their reputation , but the toxicity will never stop since it is ingrained into the depth of their culture 
Overall a very solid work culture , 9 to 5 , with people who were passionate about working at Ubisoft 
Employees are afraid to speak their mind 
This cultivates a culture of fear 
During your onboarding , expect to be introduced by HR to a wide range of good initiative like Creating a Safe and Respectable Workplace and platform like Whispli 
They encouraged toxic behavior for year and when the public found out about how they had ignored massive sexual harassment complaint , a well a countless report of bullying from abusive manager , they put on a fake act pretending to listen 
Ubisoft actually doe n't care and will never change , they are just trying to save face 
Absolutely despicable company with the most abusive manager imaginable 
Management is basically non existent unless they need you for something , Workplace culture everyone is to their self 
Workplace culture is extremely cliquish and juvenile , common in many `` young '' company 
The office ha a really chill vibe and most people are very nice and really care about each other 
They expect you to work long hour and they do n't allow you to bank any of your overtime hour 
With a friendly culture and helpful people around , I wa glad to have my internship there 
Interaction between people and company culture are good 
Great place to work ! The staff and management care for coworkers and subordinate 
Zero tolerance of abuse elevated this environment to the BEST place I 've ever worked for 
Good organization for Gamers 
Very social culture 
The atmosphere and dress code is rather laid back but a great management team 
Employees always have a clear idea of what is expected out of them 
When I switched over from an ISP in Montreal , which tend to have old mentality , I wa charmed by Ubisoft 
Good place to work where people treat each other with respect and kindness 
People appreciated each other 's hard work , which made it easier when tough situation came up 
Ubisoft ha been very comfortable and easy going 
People are friendly , but with the size of the company , it sometimes feel a bit corporate and lack the personal , fun culture of smaller studio 
The best place to work it ha the best culture in the corporate industry 
Great workplace and Very Friendly Culture 
The culture within this company is trash Great company but this particular location is full of racism 
Make sure to be on time and ready to work , CRC is very strict on attendance policy , no matter if you have an emergency or you feel terrible and all you want is to lie in bed , you are expected to bring what they call their thought of a valid excuse ( death note , doctor note , court note , army note ) signed and printed , even if you had an emergency along the way to work expect to bring a valid excuse or else it will count a a warning or strike 
Ubisoft Toronto delivers on many level , such a an easy working environment , lot of party gathering , an openness to speak your mind , being creative , sharing in may similar interest , and having many perk to boot ! I 'm so glad to be part of this company and working with many talented people 
We also celebrate aur project launch 
Very Cliquey , and they will not hesitate to fire you in order to have a scape goat for any problem that arise not even related to your responsibility 
make sure to be on time and ready to work , pretty strict on attendance policy 
very casual dress code 
That will not change for me 
Top-tier video game company with steady and thoughtful management 
make sure to be on time and ready to work , pretty strict on attendance policy 
very casual dress code 
You can meet the most genius people in the game industry all over the world , and the company 's culture wa very comfortable for everyone 
The hardest part of working there is that they want the best quality of work and productivity , but will rarely allow of you to prove yourself 
The management is rude and doe n't know how to respectfully and professionally communicate with their employee 
Ubisoft is not about the player or the employee , but only about itself 
Do n't ever work for this company ! 
It ’ s a fast paced , no nonsense working environment , and the line of responsibility are clearly drawn , which I appreciate 
Interesting city and culture 
French company so french management and politics 
I appreciate company like Ubisoft who emphasize hard work , but also know that the best work environment is one in which worker can feel comfortable 
I never thought that working in the gaming industry can be so fun ! I loved working for them a they are people oriented and the culture is great 
From your lead to colleague , everyone is out there to help and learn together , A very understanding and fun to work culture 
Ubisoft is a good company 
Great environment that inspires creativity and appreciates innovative employee 
Great culture , creative , driven team 
High expectation to perform above and beyond 
Ubisoft is a great company , with a good work environment and culture 
Ubisoft UK is great place to work , employee are actively encouraged to be creative , bring new idea and immerse themselves in their role 
The general feeling is generally 'work hard and play hard ' when the pressure is on to meet a deadline then it 's all hand on deck and it 's a common to work late to get the job done , flexibility is important but when it 's quieter , in the summer month especially there 's a good emphasis on fun and relaxation and opportunity for the team to relax and unwind together 
With hard work come play and the studio culture make sure we all know , respect and have fun with eachother 
Thinking for yourself is greatly discouraged and executing order blindly like a robot is the ideal employee A lot of unqualified people in the management , favoritism and a lot of fixed idea 
Good game culture and graphic background 
The culture is very much like a family , both the pro and the con 
Cultural and historical adaptation and accuracy were thing that I wa extreme passionate in guarding 
I developed a kin sen of spotting every that wa political incorrect or age rating contradicting 
The culture in Ubisoft is great the people are very helping and understanding 
Overall , you 're not treated a a person 
Typical day at work : Brand positioning , product launch , community building 
`` I wa immediately told to clean out my desk and escorted to the street a if I were caught stealing 
[LISTSEP]
Work time is 8:30 
5:30 including break , good learning opportunity , management is also good , the most enjoyable part is you have to play game , what else we want 
Very nice work life balance ( unlimited sickness day also if needed ) 
When it get busy , it get BUSY , and keeping up with the necessary information can be very stressful 
Typical game dev environment with flexible work hour , but you are expected to put in around 10-11 hour of work a day 
For a `` fun '' work environment , the company is very much bogged down by bureaucracy 
The hardest part of the job is separating work-life and personal life , a most of your colleague will not hesitate to respond to an email after hour or during weekend 
Work life balance definitely need to be better 
As a software engineer with a creative streak and a need for human interaction in the workplace , this office wa the definition of perfect : comfortable desk area , natural lighting , and a genuinely great balance between work and leisure 
Ubisoft Montreal being a video game studio mean that , by default , your work involves play 
This doe not mean that play becomes work , strictly speaking ; an average day at work did n't feel completely like work , and that 's impressive 
Fun and relaxed working environment 
Good work life balance 
They overwork you and they do not care how burnt out you are 
When you do take a personal day , they still call you for help 
The reason why I wa not able to stay at the company wa due to my own personal problem , coupled with the covid virus situation 
However , I would say the pay a well a balance between work and personal life is lost here 
But , if you think you need to have a personal life , this might become problematic 
I would come into work and grab some coffee and then head to my desk 
The shift started with checking my email and getting my desktop set up for the shift for the day 
I would speak with manager to see what work wa to be done for the day and then get to work 
The work environment wa very laid back and there wa no dress code so coming to work in comfy clothes wa nice 
The most enjoyable part of the job wa making customer happy and helping them with the issue at hand 
Wages would n't cover my mortgage even with full time hour 
Was let go after I turned down working full time because I wa already sorting a full time job in addition to part time here to pay bill 
GOOD WORK-LIFE BALANCE 
Nice work environment Good work life balance Fair salary Nice activity by HR Nice colleague Nice and Challenging Work Average Management Average Benefits 
No work pressure 
No work from Home policy 
In/Out Timings are strictly need to follow 
The work environment is very good and Work life balance is awesome 
The work wa not so stressful & you manage your one time 
A very neat workplace with nice facility for the employes and fair amount of fun with the amount of work there 
Does n't feel like overwork but you learn new thing every day 
The work culture is very friendly and doe n't give any stress 
Good work-life balance 
Managers are friendly but work pressure varies from manager to manager 
There are several available shift to work , weekend are generally included 
Good Worklife Balance Colleagues were fun and enjoyable Organic organisation structure Lots of room to learn and grow Unable to advance career due to headcount Empty Promises 
It wa a great working experience and everyone is nice 
You can enjoy various activity and game with other colleague 
*Pros* No stress and no heavy workload 
A lot of fun , great team leader and nothing stressful 
Review call or contact from previous day , log in and begin the day , begin chat for the day , problem solving , finding the solution for the customer , documenting the chat 
Management is ok , they support you in your day to day 
Workplace is pretty relaxed and fun 
The benefit are good and the work life balance is pretty good if you are a serious person and do 
The working time at ubisoft is good a per the project 
Working with the team is the best part and fun a the culture and environment at Ubisoft is not that stressful 
Shifts , however , are really short : 4hrs 
I loved the work life balance culture 
I wa always able to take time off when needed , come in late or leave early , etc 
Very little stress or difficult deadline 
Very nice work place , had a ton of fun , incredible colleague , made some friendship 
Nice work environment , friendly face , great work-life balance 
Typical work day consist of sitting in front of a monitor engaging with player on social medium site that you were given access to 
In Ubisoft entertainment private limited working environment is very good 
I learnt what to do very quickly and I enjoyed working 
The work timing are great to give the best balance to professional and personal life 
All the people that work there are nice and work hard 
I enjoy the serenity of the environment and the worker where very kind and respectful of my position 
The most enjoyable part of the work is working with video game , and the relaxed dress code 
Work balance but ca n't expect too much from this company 
Pros : Relaxed work enviroment Made good friend Cons : Management will not listen to their employee 
Care more about the time on the phone then helping the customer 
It 's video game so crunch time is often taken for granted 
I built up my confidence in everything here Lovely/Fun Work Environment Got a chance to work with big and reputed Ubisoft gaming studio in the world and with the people a well 
Ubisoft is a heaven where people dont work for money they work for enjoying their work 
They have a tight team of project manager and a solid production team , which allows me to focus on creative 
They also support a good work-life balance , which is a breath of fresh air 
Autonomy and teamwork 
Work life balance is Good 
A typical day at Ubisoft is usually amazing and we do n't even know how the day pass 
Work timing is flexible and friendly environment 
Busy upcoming year with Vivendi 
team member support each others and build up knowledge also The work culture is pretty good where there is a balance between work and life and fun loving environment 
Ubisoft surely know how to keep employee happy 
The workplace wa a lot of fun to work in , however they do expect their associate to work hard 
The management and other employee are extremely relaxed and great to work with 
Most enjoyable part wa I wa able to get my work done everytime 
Nice for startup , good company for fresher , good care of employee , chill environment to work in with hardly any work pressure , lead are friendly and helpful 
loved my job 
Worked with a few friend , learned to open and close a store by myself , got a lot of grease burn , would n't trade them for the world 
For a manager , the life depends if he know to select his team and develop it 's member 
People working there are friendly , supportive and approachable 
no overtime there 
Employees made my job so enjoy able no matter what is wa that I wa doing 
worked in prince of Persia and fry cry it best time in my job life at that time so many thing i learn about a gaming process and working pipe line management 
Fantastic work-life balance 
Great co-worker 
Playing game is the most enjoyable part of the job 
Tight working schedule 
The building is old and absolutely filthy , the workload is completely unbalanced from job title to job title , and management is often completely clueless 
The most enjoyable part of the job is that you stay all day and run test , even play game sometimes ( I can say ) and besides that , you develop creativity , communication and team working skill 
3 ) Challenging and creative work , improve and develop our potential constantly 
The hardest part of the work I would say because I like it is to stop working after office hour 
Great experience overall Everyone wa very friendly Everyone wa also very hardworking and I felt a if I wa part of the team there even if I wa just there to play and judge the game 
So , you may be excited about your current project and giving it all you got , and suddenly , a directive from Montreal demand that you help them with a struggling project 
Lot of thing i have learned while working with Ubisoft such a handling pressure , team work , thinking out of box , but most of all the importance of planning in work life 
Had a great experience though i wa there for le time i enjoyed my work there 
I love everything about game , and I love to work on big project no matter how hard it is 
A very demanding but quite fun working environment with very passionate people working closely together to create amazing experience for everyone to enjoy 
If you arrive early 8:00am ( two hour before most management arrives ) , and leave 2 hour before management leaf 4:30pm , you 're perceived a not putting in 100 % effort 
But if you sleep in and arrive at 10 am and leave at 6:30 PM then you are perceived a putting in your all 
Same amount of time 
The company is for the most fun to have at Work 
Very relax and fun 
Good place to have balanced life and work 
Yeah the work is tought but it 's worth it 
I woke up at around 5AM to work in Canadian timezone , it wa by home so they would email me an update code , or tell u to update the beta when they had it updated , this part wa very efficient , however the people chosen the manage the all together were quite dis-organised , dealing with them wa quite difficult a sometimes they did n't even show up for our hour , and we 'd have to organise ourselves on Skype 
The job wa home based so we 'd converse through Skype , the rest wa very fun and enjoyable , my co-worker very nice and were really good to talk to , the most enjoyable part however wa definitely the gameplay part and the actual taking part in the job itself 
Worked very hard , loved the gig , even though the software wa buggy enough to cause work loss regularly and supervisor gave u contradictory information a to how the work should be completed 
I can say that I look forward to going to work everyday 
Apart from the often stressful deadline and long hour , the company and most of it people come together and create a unique atmosphere of friendship 
very busy place to work 
I learnt about testing and prioritizing my task 
It is a fun place to work and i enjoy my time here 
The work-life balance could not be better , a the culture there is one that endorses a commitment to bettering your personal life 
[LISTSEP]
Direct leadership seems to care and be grounded 
Toxic manager 
An absolute mess of top-down management 
Leading MNC in gaming platform 
People are surrounded with golden heart manager all around in ubisoft 
the working environment is good , but the top management suck a lot , really a lot , they do n't want doer , they need talker 
Directed the launch of Ubisoft title into the UK market 
I used to be the IT Manager & Senior UNIX Consultant 
[LISTSEP]
Best company to work 
Lot of good peopletech is okProjects interestingStudio growing way too fastBig culture gap between projectsMore and more politicsDo n't stay too long there : management will screw you soon or later 
Started at end 20 and been here for more then 10 year in the IT 
High turnover 
+ Only positive thing I can say is that I got a foot into the industry 
It also ha good upward mobility 
It seems hard to get converted to a full-time employee , however 
Currently can not recommend working there to anyone 
Extremely high turnover 
One of the best work experience I 've had 
I worked at Ubisoft Sweden for 5 year 
Ubisoft is a terrible company to work for 
Great place to launch your career , but promotion and compensation adjustment do not reflect rising cost of living in Toronto 
Also , difficult to move up the ladder if you do not speak French 
I worked at the Ubisoft Montreal studio for 4 month a part of an internship with the CRM team 
That being said , this is predictable and should be expected if you 're aiming for a marketing-adjacent position like this one 
Encouraging management , good learning opportunity 
Recommended to anyone who want to experience a career in gaming industry 
The manager do n't help you move up 
Ubisoft is a great place to work a 
If you truly think work is your life , you are at the right place 
The hardest part about the job wa learning about computer troubleshooting since I had no background in that field and it wa a lot to take in at once 
If you are job hunting but you are not getting a job then Ubisoft is the place for you 
Written test , technical round 1 , technical round 2 and then HR 
working at Ubisoft is interesting 
The company structure is clearly broken and employee suffer from lack of vision from upper management , lack of clear ownership , lack of clarity on your future in the company 
Overall , it 's not all bad , but the company put in no effort to retain talent 
I worked in GNS and the experience is one of the best in my career 
The job culture wa very good 
video game are great , and you geat to work with real passionate people ! But it 's also a crowded market that come with a few sacrifice 
Not easy to crack the interview 
overall I would recommend this a a good place to work 
For a fresher / or the person who is ambitious to learn regardless of salary , this company is a good place to work 
It wa my first job in IT , it wa good for getting some experience in testing field 
It 's definitely a startup job for young people who do n't have a lot of year of experience , because you will be learn a lot but could be a nightmare always depending your team mate 
For a game-maniac , Ubisoft is definitely a place to achieve your dream and experience the studio life 
Company is good for fresher who want to start career in testing 
Career might get stuck if remained for more than 2 year in Ubisoft 
Great place to work 
I got this job though an acquaintance 
Learned so much during those 2 month about prop modeling , and texturing for game 
Ubisoft is a great place to work if you love the gaming industry 
At Ubisoft , new people get to learn many thing in the field of testing with new software 
I have been at Ubisoft le than a year 
You get very le appraisal compared to current market statistic and also career growth is zero 
Hey I worked at Ubisoft under contract , first off they do n't pay well for the location Morrisville ha some high paying job but this job only pay temp 12 
I had a really great time interning at Ubisoft 
The employee were amazing , and I felt i learned a good amount from interning there 
No real growth within the company unless someone relocates to another state or country 
Job is nice if you are going to school or have roommate to be able ease the burden of bill 
If you 're looking to pursue this job and grow be prepared to stay in your position for two year for a slight pay increase 
You wont advance and if you 're not buddy buddy with higher ups or people that control thing there , good luck 
Fun job with lot of potential to be a great place to work but too many internal problem 
I worked on contract at Ubisoft for 6 month Pros • Open Door Policy • Chance to grow in the industry • Encourage for IJPs Cons • Salary is bit low 
Difficult to advance rapidly and very low salary 
Also , if you are not in the inner circle of higher ups working there , then forget about , is not a secure job and always have a backup 
( I mean no job is 100 % secure but this take the cake ) always think about having a backup plan y you plan to join 
Now you do learn lot of technical support for pc and console that will help you with other job a well a a sense of what go behind the scene in a gaming company 
At UBISOFT , my mission wa to animate 3D and / or 2D character , use the game engine , optimize , and archive the animation , a well a to Rig and Skin different character on international project 
A gaming industry company with a lot of available position for both entry level and senior level staff 
As an entry level you will have the opportunity to grow your knowledge and professionalism and understand the IT environment 
Depending on your quality , you may have different option for promotion , but mostly it will require a lot of year of dedication 
i contract in so that show you that i dont have job security 
Most people is very friendly , love their career and have a great passion in the gaming industry 
Very limited opportunity to advance in the company , often held back by management who `` need you where you are '' 
Getting into the game industry and delivering multiple title give you such an enjoyment when seeing others play your game 
No real growth within the company unless someone relocates to another state or country 
Job is nice if you are going to school or have roommate to be able ease the burden of bill 
If you 're looking to pursue this job and grow be prepared to stay in your position for two year for a slight pay increase 
Hence if you are looking for a stable future with Ubisoft you can not grow much financially 
Most of the employee leaf this company after 2 year 
Consistently one of the lowest paid technical position in the area 
learn lot of technical support for pc and console 
I love video game so working here wa a dream 
As for Ubisoft a a company I would work for , it pretty bad 
If you get hired on the ground level there is a good chance you are working through a temp agency 
You will be given the chance to innovate and creator 
learn lot of technical support for pc and console 
Ubisoft for me wa a dream 
I worked there for around 8 month all together 
Enjoyed the people I worked with , but if you are not permanent , then it is not a great place to really work 
Also , if you are not in the inner circle of higher ups working there , then forget about maybe working there permanently 
It is a very ( who you know ) career advancement 
OKAY COMPANY TO WORK But no chance to get hired here at all 
No room for career growth 
Ubisoft is a good place to work if you are a hardcore gamer with no family responsibility or commitment 
Good place to work 
Very good job security 
To start working at Ubisoft through their customer support , you have to start off a a temp employee 
This can mean you work 4 month at a time on at least 3 different occasion before you ever get the opportunity to get full time employment 
Some employee will work a temp for a year or two straight , at a time with no full time offer 
This company ha improved me a lot personally and professionally a well 
I love working at Ubisoft 
5 year for me at Ubisoft 
When it come to career growth financially and knowledge wise , the result are le then satisfactory 
Working for Ubisoft ha been a fun experience so far 
Absolutely amazing place to work 
Awesome work environment and office space ( s ) 
Good to start your career after college 
You have to struggle a lot to get into next level 
Employ cant move from QE to development even though he ha potential 
HR community is not responsive 
A lot of opportunity to grow based on talent and networking 
A very good company that provides training and knowledge , before you will be given the position 
If you are key performer for sure company will take care of you be it international mobility or challenging project 
I wa customer support at Ubisoft for a couple of month for a temporary position 
The company ha little room for growth especially in a foreign language position which is what I am doing 
The hardest part of working for Ubisoft is not knowing if your job is stable 
It is an amazing place to work , but many people are hired on only for a short time 
It wa a good place to gain experience but not good to stay long a your whole career 
best job for anyone who is a fresh graduate and want to learn about the industry staff were very kind and sweet no issue 
I wa there for an internship in their IT department , and it wa absolutely awesome 
The work environment is just beyond comparison 
this job wa amazing not long but ıt wa heaven ubısoft is all gamers want to work so ı learned fırst disipline ruby qa standart console game 
Ubisoft Annecy is a great place to work 
If you can get past those con , it is a great place to work , and is a secure company to work for 
Ubisoft Toronto is a place that help you develop into role that let you discover your skill and talent 
Along the way you are mentored by Toronto 's top talent in all discipline 
Superb Company Great & Positive Work Environment This company provide a lot to learn Co-workers are great Job is secure Only negative point is `` le salary '' for newbie 
You 'll learn a lot about the game industry and I 've seen people thrive here just a well a those without any gaming experience 
Good place to grow and move on 
Most of the people working there are pretty young 
You will find lot of talent artist in this company 
Lots to learn depending on the department you work in , everyone is eager to stay innovative ! 
I enjoyed working here , though it wa difficult to try and change advancement track once you arrived 
The hardest part of my job is advancement and low carrier growth 
long hour with a promise of a permanent position and wa never going to happen 
Fast-paced working environment 
Working for Ubisoft ha always been a dream of mine , and I got to be a part of that dream for a short while 
Though everything wa contract work , I would gladly work there again 
A day with Ubisoft would be like any other in-home Artist job , you receive and email and later a conference call 
Once the design and/or job requirement are completed you email/fax your work to your Senior Artist 
The best part of the job is working a a designer for game , magazine and promotional thing of the sort 
Its the gaming industry ! Job security is fleeting at best but youhave to love the poeple you work with and the work 
No skill development program for employee , No respect for hard work , no hope for future promotion , low salary , Discrimination with employee from outer state from local on higher position 
to work for a great company and to be involved in a great AAA videogames production wa a really an amazing experience 
I started my career a a game tester in this company and this fetched me lot of Knowledge and i decided i would choose this path though i wa not a Software technical guy 
The Best Experience of my career 
Work on support ticket higher level 
One of my favorite work experience so far 
I had the chance of being part of a new department , the first quality control localization department of Ubisoft world wide 
There are two big advantage to working at Ubisoft 
First , they hire more friendly people than the other studio I worked at in the past 
This is because Toronto doe n't have much of a game development industry 
So , no competition for talent 
There ha to be some advantage to working at small company right ? Another reason you may feel like a pawn is that even if the Toronto studio had good intention for it people , many of u got shuffled and moved to new role and project due to another studio 's need 
A best place for the gamers to work and is the best company which I worked 
Game Industry is a large exciting field , same fun a working in animation field 
working there gave me a new horizon to explore , my colleague are so nice and helpful 
Overall , Ubisoft is a very good place to work in if you are a passionate individual which greatly enjoys create amazing content for the whole world to enjoy 
The work environment wa amazing 
You can work on all the latest gaming console 
It 's unique work environment 
International work environment and culture 
They give me the opportunity to work on one of the most popular IP on the market and i gained a lot of experience from it 
Projects are awesome , there are very talented people , big motivation 
I had alot of responsability which helped me become more responsable and learn how HR team and big internationaly company work 
I wa hired on a temporary contract that started with two month training on proprietary software and lot of subjectivity in how the work wa to be completed ( got ta respect the NDA 's , so I ca n't offer up detail ) 
Of the four of u hired ( through multiple interview , BTW ) two of u were let go six week later for the vague `` We have an idea of what level you should have been at by this point 
With Seven year working in the field of UNIX、LINUX and ORACLE 
Technical management expertise on UNIX management , project management and quality assurance 
You are made to feel welcome and it a good place to work for Career Growth 
Ubisoft is a great company to work for 
Overall , Ubisoft 's positive make it a company anybody would be lucky to work at 
[LISTSEP]
Pay is incredibly low for the industry and that ’ s company wide 
The wage could 've been slightly better 
But salary is le because now a day all survival thing are costly and very much difficult to live in this salary 
Good salary benifit now 
The pay is low , the project are horribly managed resulting in lot of crunch , and there is an abundance of nepotism and infighting 
I have been reminded on multiple occasion by management that I am paid more than Ubisoft Pune employee and so I need to prove my worth 
Benefits are not a appealing a other tech company in the city 
Compensation and benefit could be better 
The salary seem fair and people seem to be happy 
Good benefit , including being able to play game during work hour 
The benifits are really cool with flexible timing and free breakfast a well a the people working in some depts 
For every 8 hour shift , I would receive an hour lunch and 2 15 minute break 
The pay wa great for the work I have done and i enjoyed doing the job 
Slow growth and comparatively le compensation and hike 
Pros : 
Very very le salary 
Fruits are free and once a week there bagel for everyone for free 
Temporary contract and average salary are to be expected 
Paying very le salary a compared to other organization 
Free ubisoft premium game 
I enjoyed my time there and I got along with everyone in my team , the manager wa great and we even had foodstamps too 
*Cons* For a tester , salary barely meet the monthly requirement which is something everyone expects out of a full time job 
Salary is very le almost 2yrs in Ubisoft salary is 15k per month 
Just play for your money 
Lots of perk and a fun friendly environment 
Lots of opportunity to travel and develop your skill with training and project 
Employees get access to the gym for free 
While the pay may be lacking , it certainly made up for that when it came to the team and the management , where I found like minded individual 
Salary is very le compared to other industry 
I worked for 2 year and still , salary is a big problem in Ubisoft 
Very flexible schedule , you choose what day you want to work and they give you shift accordingly 
00 an hour on top of that they do n't even get paid lunch or break and since your a temp you do n't get any overtime before permanent employee you only have free coffee 
Your hour are cut only getting 32 or le 
They not only under paid but cut our contract 
Well run managed company well appreciated lot of perk good rate of pay happy to provide training friendly company no complaint at all in all the time I have worked here plenty of scope for transgression with in company 
The pay is n't great , but it 's plenty for the area 's cost of living 
Can gain extra by staying overtime , but only when project requires 
This job pay is alright , not something that will help you live on your own or raise a family with 
You barely get vacation day unless you have have slaved yourself to earn them 
If pay wa a few more dollar it would be awesome 
You get discount on Ubisoft 's game and they often gift employee with goody 
Wages are low compared to other company , benefit are not competitive to market 
This job paid good to me and the hour were long and stressful because everything had to be perfect for these worker and when they had to let me go they didn ’ t want to because I did such a good job , overall I liked the money but worked hard for it 
They offer really low wage for the area , which is odd because EPIC Games is right down the street offer almost 4 dollar an hour more for the same job 
Be ready to work hard to prove yourself and your effort will be rewarded 
Will pay you well below the area average for that job 
While working a a temp employee , the benefit are bad ( high health insurance cost , low pay , minimal gaming benefit , no company incentives/rewards like free gear or invitation to holiday party which full time employee take advantage of ) and you are treated very unfairly compared to the full time regular employee 
Pros : -young colleague and fun atmosphere -challenging task , it 's quite difficult to get bored Cons : -long hour , work/life balance may be affected -salary and benefit could be better 
Excellent perk 
Fantastic salary and room for advancement 
The hardest part of job is salary , which is very low compared to other company 
If only the compensation package wa inline with the competition 
They take care of people and provide lot of opportunites to take on challenge , but there 's way too much unproductive politics and pay is under industry average 
The draw back are management and pay 
but it would be hard to get to work on those big good name big bonus tile , if you not have any `` friend connection '' referral 
Even though the salary is not the absolute best , Ubisoft compensate with a fair work/life balance and employee on site benefit ( Gym , on site medical clinic , massage , etc ) 
On Tuesdays you get chocolate and on Thursdays you get fruit 
Everything is excellent but salary is a little bit under estimate 
The company ha a great benefit package and treat it employee very well 
The downside of working here is the salary 
Ubisoft ha been lucky in the last 4 year , feeling no pressure to raise salary 
Huge volume of work and tight deadline usually mean plenty of overtime which also mean a considerable salary increase , but at a disadvantage for personal life 
Every amenity an employee could ask for 
Lot of oppturnity for right people 
They offer free drink on all floor , and have weight loss competition and other company wide game with prize that encourage camaraderie
