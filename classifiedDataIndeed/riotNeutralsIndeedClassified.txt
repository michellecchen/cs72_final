The company is trying to include more minority and more woman but it skews heavily male 
They allow employee to be themselves 
[LISTSEP]
Company is passionate about making a difference in the industry and for player 
I learned a lot about the pro and con of a solid company culture 
Org experienced some growing pain at the time a it matured further and sought to develop it identity and structure a an organization 
Riot really care about their employee , fantastic and creative coworkers who inspire you 
They care about their employee and handled covid well by quickly sending folk home 
The long standing culture at Riot Games is one of misogyny , false wokeness , and `` locker room talk '' 
Lots of talented colleague and great company culture 
It doesn ’ t matter how exceptional you are at your craft : if gaming isn ’ t your heart and soul you will be shunned 
It ’ s worse if you ’ re a girl there is a very specific mold they expect there 
The culture is second to none and the desire to have a positive work environment and willingness to help employee grow in any area they want is what Riot is all about 
I have nothing but good thing to say about the people and culture 
I loved working for riot game , the culture wa incredible and I felt very useful and accepted 
Well , Being totally open abut my review will mean to say that Riot Games are basically my Hero Company ! I cant tell anything Bad for them 
Riot Games try to create a laid back business culture , where colleague can build trust and speak frankly with one another 
The work culture at Riot feel very much a it 's advertised on the tin 
The people make this organization work 
The place is a cult , and I could not see until the ride wa over 
The company culture is lazy and sluggish 
I honestly loved the advertised culture , but Riot ha changed a lot in the past couple year 
The culture is rich and fun 
ha a very unique culture 
Is a fast paced environment that encourages exploration and value the input of all member on the team 
Riot wa built by entrepreneur , and still cling to that `` we 're a startup company , playing loose and cowboy with the rule in order to get the product out the door '' which worked in 2009 when Riot had startup number of employee , and player still thought that League of Legends wa just another Warcraft3 mod 
Now , with over 1200 employee worldwide , that procedureless , startup mentality is starting to bite Riot 
Did some level and character design a well a help outsource asset with the producer 
Riot Games is amazing company with great work environment , brilliant team and clear goal 
[LISTSEP]
Employees are expected to give 110 % but playtime is also encouraged 
Riot will keep you busy but it is a fun place to work 
Everyone here work hard and also know very well how to balance that with good fun 
Note : I like playing game but not for my first hour of the day at work , 2-3 hour a day in the afternoon , another hour of game on campus after eating there , then going home and paying for several more hour with Theo-Le you just played for 5 hour with during the work day every single day 
But you better love game ! 
It always felt like home coming into a job I thoroughly enjoyed 
The most enjoyable part of the job wa coordinating the live show 
Second thing is taking no money because i am volunteered but , for voluntarly job it too exhausting 
With people acting like friend and playing game every day , it can be easy to forget that you 're at work 
Never forget that you are at work 
They also have a great work life balance 
I loved coming to work and every challenging project that wa given to the team 
Management for my department specifically ha never had a `` safe '' environment and felt like a shark tank 
Facilities in particular doe have a rather poor work/life balance , however it also tends to be extremely satisfying within that team a they have an extremely amazing camaraderie 
A great place to work and live 
Do n't forget we have a campus and we are all in High-school again , staying up late playing game and working on what we are passionate about 
sometimes , a lot of work can come up , and you need to understand where to draw the line , and how exactly to ensure that you stay on top of your work 
Hardest part about the job wa my personal school schedule 
[LISTSEP]
The same complacent manager are recycled year after year with no accountability for result 
[LISTSEP]
Interview/hiring process is long and intensive 
You get to work with a lot of passionate talented people 
You own your own product and career path which come with responsibility , nobody will micro-manage you 
This wa a one of a kind job experience 
A lot of pro but then the con would be management 
Many people were put in manager role with no experience 
Over the year it ha become a factory for manager with little to no experience who are hired based on their relationship to executive at the company to grow their resume while under performing in their role 
Great place to work and learn new skill 
I took a pay cut to join Riot game , and while I enjoyed the experience overall , now that im more senior in my career , looking back there were fault 
I 've really enjoyed my time at Riot , working alongside many very passionate and very smart people and with the opportunity to learn and experience completely new craft 
You 're an engineer who like champion art ? Go have conversation with the art team and maybe propose a skin concept that may end up getting some attention 
Riot truly is a very interesting company at which to grow , learn and become awesome in the video game production industry 
The interview process is a fair representation of what it 's like to work there 
if you enjoy that process , you 'll love working there 
There is very little room to advance , and in general , the company doe n't seem to have a solid vision or strategy for where it want to be in the next year or two 
Riot Games by far is the best company to work for 
The only negative regarding Riot Games , is there is no room for advancement 
Riot tends to hire from outside rather then promote from within 
Therefore you can find yourself stuck in one position for a long time 
I learned a spectrum of skill from creating PO 's for finance , creating guidebook , workplace safety and guideline , security , IT , Leadership skill , construction , and so much more 
If you 're hired , you probably wo n't be doing what you applied for 
A great place to work for a hungry individual not just because they offer free lunch and dinner at their cafeteria , but also when it come to growth in the company and a an individual 
The Facilities department ha some Job Security/Advancement issue , however the workplace culture throughout the company is phenomenal 
But ultimately this place is heaven on earth for any gamer looking for a place to have a career 
I enjoyed my time a a contractor in Riot Games 
Riot Games wa by far my favorite job that I have had the pleasure of obtaining 
The best part of the job wa going on location and filming at Blur Studios 
Got to see and work hand on with a lot of professional equipment 
Management is an interesting beast 
Engineering manager , which are technically `` the bos '' of a specific team and/or function , and `` product manager '' , who drive the priority and the workflow of the product of team in play 
good luck ever working there again

Answered many support ticket , wa compensated through in game currency 
They also provided everyone with 1k to help setup their wfh setup 
The job wa demanding and the payment wa not worth what wa asked or required 
I had a blast working for the company and felt well compensated 
lanning and organization of the UANL ’ s “ Campeonato Intercolegial Mexicano de League Of Legends ” , 1st Latin American intercollegiate eSport tournament with award of $ 600,000 peso in scholarship 
That 's both good and bad ! It 's fun getting free food and latte ! 
And there wa only one raise during the time I wa employed 
Compensation is horrible , especially within QA 
Unlimited PTO , 401k matching 
Benefits are extremely competitive , compensation could use some work 
Benefits and work environment are the best in the industry , but like everywhere else in game development , monetary compensation lag severely behind the enterprise software development company 
Perks like unlimited PTO , company-wide vacation and a semi-annual hack-a-thon make Riot an amazing place to work , but with meteoric growth come problem of astronomical scale
