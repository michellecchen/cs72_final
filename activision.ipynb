Working for Blizzard is one of the most horrible experiences I ever had to go through. That feeling of,\"OMG I want to work for Blizzard.\" Quickly changes when you start and becomes,\"OMG what have I done?!\" Management: Good ol boys club. 98% of management have been there for 10+ years and were a part of the company during its \"golden years\". Management is stale and tends to shun/discriminate against you if you do not agree to their every word. Their word is the bible and shall not be questioned! They hand out write-ups like its candy and tend to keep to the groups of tenured people. If you complain to HR, they say they listen but normally just ignore you and then say you never told them. Overall, management is just bad here. Fellow Employees: Some are cool I\\'ll admit but most of them feel like they are high and mighty because they\\'ve been there for so long. If you\\'re able to find a good click of people then thats great! I\\'m lucky I have but I have seen new employees come on board and are shunned and felt to be unwelcome. I was one of those people until I found a group I clicked with. \"Diversity\": Blizzard preaches that they are very diverse but when it comes to hiring, 8/10 will be men. There are barely any women in leadership roles and those that are tend to be ignored or overruled by those higher than them. The clubs that are on campus are run by fellow employees but even that is a mess. With the amount of work everyone has on their plate, their last thought is on groups. Many events will be \"planned\" and then cancelled which isn\\'t necessarily anyone\\'s fault but it proves that diversity and accepting those who are different really isn\\'t a top priority. Advancement: Not gonna happen. Like I said, everyone in a management position has been there for 10+ years and they\\'re not moving anywhere so your only option is to look for a better position outside the company. From what I have seen there is currently a very high turnover rate at Blizzard. Pay: Low of the low. If you work at Blizzard and want to live in Irvine, you\\'ll either need a lot of roommates to cover the bills or someone who is throwing out money to you. Pay raises are very rare! Also, don\\'t ask for a raise. If you ever do you\\'re looked at with disgust and told to get back to work. Work/Life balance: LOL!
