Impossible to get promoted,"Santa Monica, CA","You do the work of a level way above you only to get paid pennies for what you're achieving. There is also a culture of lower employees being overworked and promised certain benefits (pay raises/promotions/etc) only to find themselves doing the work and two years later, not getting what they were promised. Additionally, there's a pattern of mass employee exits and ZERO backfill, leaving those left behind to pick up a ton of work, which isn't doable or feasible.",2,"If you have a good manager, it helps things a LOT.

Below industry standard pay in the highest cost of living area in the country,"Software Engineer, Data Analyst","you cannot afford to work at Blizzard... Everyone I worked with lived with 4-5 co-workers all together in small cramped housing or rental units. The pay is below industry standards and far below the area cost of living. Blizzard feels that it is such a priviledge to work at Blizzard that they can pay far below the gaming industry average salary for any and all positions at all levels. The pay is so far below the area cost of living that everyone who works at Blizzard is basically destitute, and that is considering the 80 hour work weeks with 16-20 hours 7 days a week especially during crunch times before game update release dates. The benefits are not worth the extra cost you have to pay in for.",1,"16 hour average work days 7 days a week during crunch periods lasting for several months, poverty level pay for the area in Irvine California, Management staff are generally family members or friends with no previous management education, experience or training",

Unprofessional dream killer,Quality Assurance,"Its a contract job for people with dreams of game development. It takes advantage of people by giving them expensive insurance and poor wages. They justify low pay by giving their employees merchandise.The management is awful, they ignore office bullying despite being reported over 5 times. They come in late and scold you for being late. They get wasted and or high. They are down right disrespectful to employees.They will cater and hold various events for morale, even though they use that to justify their abuse.Overall, a poor contract job with rude management.

Get used to this and take advantage of the lap as it will be your only outlet.Testing unreleased products is great, and it's very rewarding to see people's first look at something you've been working on for months.Treatment from low-level superiors is often lacking, expect to be treated as if you are in day care. Seniors constantly seem to have something to prove, and that 'something' is that they are better than you in all respects - right or wrong. You will not trust the full picture or even a third of the required information.In stark contrast, leadership is often much more relaxed and easy to get along with.This is not where your dreams of becoming a videogame developer will begin.

"A fun place to work, but most likely will only work there temporary.",Quality Assurance Tester (temp job),"Overall I had a great experience at Activision, the only thing negative about working there is when you work 12 hour shifts.

A very unique environment that I'm happy I got to work in.,QA Tester,"Working QA at Activision wasn't like any other job that I had worked at or have worked at since. It honestly kinda felt like being part of a big awkward family, and not in that stupid corporate PR ""family"" sort of way. Things were generally pretty laid back and friendly and the managers got to know most of the employees that they frequently worked with on a fairly personal level. The only real problems that I had with the job were things like: you might not be making enough to make the job worth your while unless you are taking the absurd overtime hours, the majority of positions above your managers will treat you like dirt and only barely allot your managers any respect at that, and that the QA position is considered seasonal but they don't tell you when your last day is so you just end up wondering when your job is going to end instead of being able to plan around it.",4,"Sometimes offers free meals, good overtime pay, unique friendly work environment and culture, long breaks","Rude higherups, never know what you are going to be doing when you come in, doesn't pay well without overtime"
Overall a negative experience,QA Tester,"I do not recommend anyone to work there.The salary is really low for a city like Dublin, contracts are temporary, max 18months. Career growth is non existant, they pretend like everyone has a chance when it's really all about those already permanent.Expect to work weekends and banks holidays. Management is really really bad, they treat people poorly, especially temporary testers.

Abandon all hope,Quality Assurance Tester,"One of the worst companies I've worked for and Quality Assurance is the epitome of a thankless job. The pay is terrible. They posted 7.5 billion dollars in 2018 and just recently increased tester salaries to a whole $12 an hour. There are signs at retail positions in my area for $14 - $15. That is how little the company values QA. Metrics are the name of the game yet QA employees are not rewarded for meeting miles stones with number of bugs submitted. Oh our bosses get reamed out when a critical showstopper is missed, who then in turn ream us out as a group, but catch something egregious just before a major games expo...Pat on the head and a ""good job"" Developers talk down to us in comments, insult our intelligence, and treat us as a nessecary evil. Burn out is common, turn over is huge. Good workers are rewarded with more responsibility for no extra pay. This adds to resentment, burn out and quitting. Bad workers are common and not fired nearly fast enough because you still need a crew to sail your ship even if the majority of them are useless. Don't come here thinking this is your ""foot-in-the-door"" like some many naive kids I see. You will never get out of QA. The CEO or some executive will never come over and see you doodling during your break and be so impressed by your subpar weeb drawings that you are elevated to a character artist. QA is where dreams and dreamers go to die. You could make lead, or project lead maybe. But the company has routinely laid off large groups of QA positions when profits didn't meet their unrealistic expectations. So even - more...",1,,
Great Coworkers.. Frustrating Job,Functional QA Tester,"QA testing at Activision involves some video game playing but mostly involves searching and writing bugs as well as marking off testing in lists and verifying bug fixes. It's an office job involving video games more than a job about playing video games. This job requires a lot of flexibility as communication from other offices can be sparse and unclear which can lead to a lot of waiting to be able to do things. What we are doing can be changed at a moment's notice. The overall organization can feel scattered and all over the place. What's more is, because our testing office is nearly constantly hiring, newer people always outnumber people who have been here a while. Many people pick up the job quite quickly, but the imbalance of new people unsure of how to do things leads to a lot of mistakes and things falling through the cracks. In many ways, it feels like more experienced testers still do the bulk of the work despite the ginormous team we have on staff. I have met a lot of really good people doing this job, some of which are the best coworkers I've ever had, but that doesn't make up for the daily frustrations of this job. We had been on crunch for 4 months (12hr days 6 days a week) and that wore everyone down substantially and eliminates any healthy work/home balance. There are some opportunities for advancement, but for the average tester, there is no hope of moving up even if you do a lot of the work people above you do already. Especially with the quantity of new people this can mean having more responsibilities and doing a lot more leading without a pay raise - more...",2,,

"Fun environment, but the pay and hours are not for everyone",QA TESTER,"Depending on your project, you will find yourself working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week, for weeks or month prior to launch. The Leads are rather hands off, leaving things in the hands of senior testers. These senior testers are generally decent at delegation of tasks, but there were multiple instances of normal testers having to waste time due to their inefficiency at getting things done. 12 hour days would not be needed if the people in charge were more on top of getting things done. Overtime pay is nice, but the base pay leaves much to be desired.",2,,

"Fun Place to work, with some big cons.",Quality Assurance Tester,"Working at Activision has to be the focus of your life. Working QA does not give the employee much notice, if any, for if work will be required on weekends. It was frequently required. It is a fun environment with enjoyable company and management. However, QAMN feels like it is seperated from the main Company of Activision. While the locational management is fantastic, the overall company seems to just have QA under their boot for whatever the whims of the developers are. If you do not have much else to do and would love to work with a fun group of people on fun projects then this is not bad. However if you have other things to do outside of work, it gets in the way of personal development.",3,,
This isn't a job its a death sentence.,Quality Assurance Tester,"If you're expecting your hard work to ever be rewarded stay far away. QA positions are still treated like an outsourced job, and management is too chicken to stand up to corporate to fix things. Contracted positions ensure that you never have job security and that you are expendable regardless of performance. Good for someone fresh out of high school since they'll take anything that breathes but otherwise stay away from this picture perfect example of corporate greed.",2,Free terrible games.

Austin's Customer Service center has a unique atmosphere.,Specialist Game Master - Customer Support,"Working at Activision Blizzard's Austin campus was a great experience, the atmosphere was like being with a family. Blizzard's always been overwhelmingly accepting to all woks of life. With how fun, friendly and accepting the fellow employees are, it almost makes up for the work load and the slightly lower pay compared to other like jobs. Working for a video game company; as Customer Service, you do interact with an interesting customer base. Being gamers, we're far more passionate about our games and interactions. Customer interactions tend to lean harder to both ends of the spectrum. You'll face as many un-fun contacts as the run of the mill every day contacts; great and impressionable contacts can be far and few between. Burn-out can be a real issue. Stress in the workplace is an on-going problem. When choosing the Austin campus, if you're wanting to work your way up the chain to non-Customer Service jobs. Making the step to Irvine is a great challenge and in some cases is impossible. Being so secluded from Head Quarters, networking can be a major challenge. Don't see Customer Service as 'getting your foot in the door'.",5,"Fan base, loot, healthcare, atmosphere, family and friends","Low pay, heavy work load, burn-out, stress, seclusion from HQ"
"Long hours but very flexible, with incredible work environment and management.",Quality Assurance Tester,"A typical work day is 8:30am to 5:30pm or 5:30pm to 2:30am for night shift, Monday to Friday with varying weekend work. During crunch time for games, typically between June and December, the hours can become more prevalent and can increase to 6 days a week regularly. This job is very team oriented and you are always around other people in a bullpen style office. The work environment is very friendly and casual but professional with a focus on the current project. Project can be moved around a lot and requires you to remain on your toes and learn as you go. The hardest part for me personally was the crunch time hours in which the hours were increased dramatically but the overtime pay was well worth it. Management is very good as they higher internally from people that use to be in your position, so there is a better connection. Overall, if you are someone that has a lot of time to work, you enjoy gaming and working with people with the same passion as you to help make them work, then this is the place for you.",4,"Management, Flexibility, Work environment","Long hours, Small window for advancement, Job security"

Frustrating and unorganized but a fun environment.,QA Analyst,"From my experience working at the Activision QA MN branch, I have had a lot of fun as well as experienced a lot of adversity. Entry level positions are all contract based, and with most contracts, temporary. Advancement opportunity is severely limited. It often feels as if it is not based on qualifications but whether or not management likes your personality. The hourly rate is very low as with most entry level jobs, which is understandable. However as it is contract, there is no chance for pay increase in relation to how well the job is done. So, someone who performs to the best of their ability is always going to be paid the same as someone who performs the bare minimum. So, treat the job for what it is. Temporary and used for experience. As it is a contract job, I have met a lot of new and interesting people who have come through the job. Coworkers are almost always friendly towards each other and finding new friends is fairly easy. Most people who work here are all into the video game scene so it is easy to spark new conversations. Direct management is always within reach as they are on the testing floor near the other testers at all times. An open door policy with higher management is in place making conversing with management very simple. Management is, for the most part, very helpful and nice towards testers. Of course, there's always going to be some abrasion, but that's something that comes with all jobs. HR is also always close by and more than willing to help which is very nice.

Incredible experience,Quality Analysis Tester,"Typical day on the job is high pressure to ""break the game"" Management was more than willing to answer any questions I had. The culture was what you'd expect; full of gamers. The hardest part of this job is during crunch time, you eat sleep and test the game which makes work/life balance difficult if you're a family man/woman. The most enjoyable part I found was getting an inside look at the video game industry and how it functions. Definitely a great experience if you're an avid gamer.

I'd go into detail but the NDA doesn't allow me to talk about my NDA...no, seriously. As a game tester you get to see the game in it's worst possible state. There will be days the game is barely functional and you are expected to just ""deal with it"". It can be incredibly frustrating at times. Mandatory overtime is to be expected and they are VERY upfront about that. During crunch, 12 hour shifts 6-7 days a week are common. Yes, you will be working every weekend from now until Ragnarok. I can't tell you the number of people that have quit because they didn't want to work the weekend. The company relies too heavily on metrics and unrealistic target predictions to make sure it's getting its money's worth. This causes everyone to ""game the system"" by writing up 100s of low priority bugs simply because they are easier to find and write. Management tries to help as best they can but has very little power/authority to make any meaningful changes. Company culture is CYA (Cover Your *ss). Doing the absolute minimum is what I've learned working here. There is no incentive to go the extra mile, you won't be rewarded. You are contract and thus will NEVER get a raise. You will also be making the same as the worst/laziest tester. Good employees are rewarded with more work and responsibility for the same wage.

Culture can be especially hard for women - very few are in leadership roles and the company's values tend to promote combativeness and aggression. The company does attempt to acknowledge successes and offer rewards to lower-level employees who are outperforming expectations but the company could do better.

Management knows how long a tiresome the process can get and do anything they can to boost moral. free food frequently, and lots of promotional products for game as they come out, movie screenings, and plenty of casual hang out time to relax. its a lot of work and very high competition for positions but they make you feel like your part of something and its more like hanging out with friend than dealing with coworkers.",5,"Great environment, great people, great perks.","- Contract positions, nothing full time.

As time moved on and the work changed, so did priorities and the atmosphere. Work became more of a slog and i started to enjoyed the people I was working with and for less and less. Eventually, it became to much stress for not enough pay, and I was literally sleeping under my desk and working for works on end consecutively on a regularly basis.

Awesome environment / Low pay,In-game Support Representative (Tier 2),"Blizzard is a company I could see myself working for my whole life, but only if I was able to find a better type of job within the company as well as better pay. This is a video game company and the atmosphere matches what you'd expect. It's very laid back and people can be themselves. In fact, it's encouraged. The only two things that drove me away are the pay and the type of work I was doing. I was a customer service representative. Most of the time, you only get to talk to customers that are upset about something, so you need to be someone with a very strong willingness to help, but also very thick skin. The pay was also fairly typical for customer service. You'd only be able to earn a decent salary if you managed to work your way up the ladder to a senior or management role, but you'd have to compete with a lot of other people to do so. There are other departments available, but many of them require the best of the best. You can get there, but it'll be a lot of work. I'd love to go back eventually. I got my 5 year sword, but I really wanted that 10 year shield!",4,"Fun atmosphere, game room, freebies","Competitive advancement, low pay"
Grinder,Senior QA Analyst,"To put it simply, Activision's QA office is simply nothing more then a grinder. They bring in testers for their seasonal launch windows and then send them on their way. They require degree's for their minimal QA role and then pay on a scale of someone with no educational experience. You can expect extremely limited job advancement as there are only a handful of full time jobs available and they typically only go to those who have developed an 'in' with the management team. This is a job for those in a transitional period of employment.",2,,
The employee vibe was amazing.,Facilities Manager,"The employees were wonderful to work with, but management would throw a wrench in the works daily. Sometimes impossible to recover from it.

All work and no play.,Manager,"As a huge gamer, ironically I've never had such little free time to play games since working at Activision. The operations tempo and overall demand was ridiculous. Commonly, when ATVI would put on ""fun"" things for us, it was only the admin staff that had the time to partake. Us in the trenches had to skip the fun or try to get one of our finance buddies to grab us a free t-shirt or ice cream that was being handed out for no particular reason. Working at the main HQ the studios were treated like precious princesses that needed their every whim attended to. AP took a subservient approach to managing their dev ops. Our leaders never knew how to say no, no matter how crazy the request was from the studios. The studios would fall behind and we at the HQ would pay the price trying to play catch-up while in turn the studios would blame us for the overall delay. Pumping out a lame CoD game every year isn't working. Wake up ATVI.",3,"Gaming culture, flexible hours","Long hours, no leisure time, horrible management"

Working in Tech Support can be really random.,Customer Service - Technical Support,"Most days would be spent answering calls and e-mails sent by customers needing help. When there were neither calls nor e-mails, we could enjoy a few minutes playing any game the company made. The best part of the job was the challenge that comes with solving a person's problem. A lot of the information was easily found on our website, so it was mostly a matter of sorting through it all. The workplace was enjoyable. Being between the programmers and ""the suits"" of the company was enjoyable to get a taste of both serious sides of video games. When a game was being developed, we occasionally got to do a little Quality Assurance of the game, which is not as easy or as ""fun"" as it sounds to the average listener. It was not about ""playing"" the game as much as it was about trying to ""break"" the game. There are only two really negative parts to the job. When you're on a team were everyone has the same high expectations of their work, you get so much done that there are no e-mails left and you have to agree to wait your turn for a call. If even one person decides to be a slacker, it can slow everything down to a crawl. Also, the internship never grew in a paying job.

From there I sort out what has been completed the day prior and hand out any test case that still needs to be done to my QA testers as well as go over any major issues that still needs further investigation. At the end of the day, I go over all issues that were submitted to developers and email any major issues as a priority to management and production. I've learned to manage my work as well as my testers and be able to prioritize the importance of what issues need to be addressed first as opposed to less sever issues. Management was great to work with. Being formed QA testers themselves, they knew what everyone was going through so they were never too hard on the employees. Testers and fellow QA Leads were all a pleasure to work with. Everyone was always helpful and willing to give advice on work. The hardest part of the job is the stress of having a deadline.

You work in the game industry,Quality Assurance Technician,"I took a job here as a tester to get my foot in the door after moving to California and previously working as an assistant producer at another game studio. Once hired you are only looked up as your position and previous work experience means nothing. The quality assurance testers are the lowest of the low and were referred to as the monsters in the basement. Overtime would be required without notice and the pay was so poor, nobody minded working the overtime. Moving up or getting hired on full time felt like complete luck and the vast majority of quality assurance testers were kept as temp employees for years non stop. My goal after working here was to move up in the industry till I was an executive, because I wanted to change the industry for the better and treat all my employees fairly and with respect. I would still approve of the CEO because he does make smart business decisions, I just think he doesn't know or care about how his lower employees are treated.",2,"We would get a free copy of the games we worked on, we would get discarded magazines, and occasionally ice cream (after the rest of the company got theres first).",The treatment of the quality assurance employees.

If you want to work in the big time of gaming and pull off some amazingly cool projects it can be done here if you work for it. Lots of resources all around you to do great work. And that is kinda the rub. Management is very layered. I needed to be a politician and an internal propagandist to get things done, because so many people need to be brought into the loop to approve any one project. Management philosophy is also very Republican and most of the top brass are big GOPers. Very what have you done for me lately environment with little loyalty shown to employees.

An experience which taught me a lot and has never been frustrating.,QA localisation tester,"Most of my professional experience is based on my 7 months job as a QA tester for Activision Dublin, where i learned and developed good skills in the QA department and where i was able to discover my best attributes in a work environment. As a QA tester i learned everything about the QA process and developed skills in some of the most important softwares in the videogame industry (Jira, for example), i also worked on franchises which are among the top tier in the industry, like Call of Duty (and it's last incarnation: Advanced Warfare) and Skylanders. As for the attributes which make me a good choice as an employee, i would like to focus on three of them: commitment, team work and resiliency. Team work is usually essential, and my experience made me learn what's the best way of doing it; working together for a higher purpose, a perfect service for the final user, i feel like commitment is one of the most important attributes when the job is a service i'm giving, the service has to be the best i can give and i've always been ready to work harder, overtime and under pressure, and that's where resiliency come into play; putting everything i have on a project and be ready to start once again the day after.",5,Good environment.,

"Seriously, look for another place.",Forklift Driver,"I worked in Distribution, which is literally the hardest work you could do at the company. Unloading trucks in 100+ degree weather, with someone higher up than you, watching you, always telling you to work harder and faster. Extremely disrespectful. Got almost no representation with my complaints, and I don't even think my complaints were reviewed. I will never come back to this place ever. Just not worth killing yourself, working, to make someone else rich. Management and office people seem to look down upon those who actually do the hard work, and are extremely ungrateful. A specific incident, is when I first started there, I was listening to my ipod in the breakroom, and the Production supervisor makes a big stink about not having electronics at work, which was totally understandable. Later that day, I see him on his phone, which since he's a supervisor, he's allowed to have, but here's the kick, he was on Facebook. Not anywhere related to work, yet he gets away with it. The only good thing that I got out of this job, was making friends with the people I directly worked with on a daily basis. I hope they find better jobs as well as myself. I also got forklift certified, but it conveniently only applies towards their company.

As a QA tester you are constantly told how important you are to the development of games like Call of Duty. When you first sign on to the position you are informed and forced to sign a contract that states you are not eligible for a bonus regardless of the games sales or performance. All of this leads to the most important thing people need to be aware of. There is zero work-life balance. We have been working six days a week, eight to twelve hours a day since August of 2020. While it easy to ask for time off, you are not eligible for PTO because you are not considered a permanent employee.

The schedule you are given is a facade expect frequent changes at a moments notice. The company will make excuses and say they are looking into structural changes but these are merely empty promises. The one positive thing about the company is the bond you create with your fellow workers. The people are truly amazing without them the job is worth nothing. Sadly you should expect frequent turnover. Know what you are getting into before working here while it’s fun to play new games this only lasts for so long. Don’t expect much of a social life you are married to the company, oh and as far as advancing in the company goes it’s very unlikely regardless of how hard you work.

Most people are given the freedom to work remotely as needed, and be off-site to look-after kids, but it's really case-to-case and overall the culture doesn't seem to have kept up with the fact that the longer-tenured employees are now married with kids and need a more realistic balance.

I actually became really good at playing the game and they made me lead in scenarios and kill opposing players. Management was fine they were very relaxed and did their best to teach us what to do and answer any questions that we might have. Coworkers were also a blast we would play ping pong on every break and we truly enjoyed playing the game. Hardest part of the job was not able to play more even thought 90% of the time we were playing. Playing the game was fun but being the first to find a bug or defect is the best feeling.

"A fun place to work, but no job security whatsoever",Quality Assurance Software Tester,"Sure, we all know there's no job security when you work QA, but looking around the office, I saw maybe 3 people who were in their late 30 and early 40s. The odds of you making in this company is basically nil. They wave the possibility of getting hired in your face, but it never happens. One QA Tester was finding 30 bugs a day, they *still* never hired him. Essentially he was a perma-temp, constantly being re-hired for the next project. I heard about another tester who also had phenomenal numbers, but after FOUR YEARS of being a perma-temp he just burned out on the job, let his numbers slip, and was let go. Even worse, I heard about a guy who worked management, but still wasn't an actual employee, he was a contract employee, he worked there as management for two years. He was finally hired on a full-time employee, then was let go two months later. Make no mistake, Activision does not give a darn about you, you have no chance of making it here, and if you're one of the lucky few hired back in the 80s, you have no chance. Still a QA tester position makes $10 and hour, and as long as you're realistic about what the job offers, it's fine.",4,Free food when working overtime,"No job security, virtually guaranteed dismissal"

"Activision: a ""below-minimum"" prison faility",Game Tester,"Being there for just a short amount of time, I already sensed that being a game tester amongst other testers in a basement-lke atmosphere, that halfway into my time there was a prison setting. There were tens of games being tested at the same time. Which seems normal for a big company like Activision. But with schedules as the same was just horrifying. We all had the same 10-minute breaks twice a day at the same time. And lunch hours all at the same time. We were trated as if we were robots programmed to take breaks all at once.There were close to 200 testers on the floor trying to buy lunch, heat their lunch in just ONE microwave. Huge lines at the vending machines. Huge lines at the restrooms. You were only able to go to the bathroom on the breaks and if you had to go, you needed permission from your QA lead who looked like he was still going to high school.",2,prison-like atmosphere,
Incredibly productive and fun place to work with a pool table and soda machine,QA Tester,"Arrive to work a little early, the line to clock in was usually pretty long. Get to my work station. Then sign in with the QA Manager and receive a copy of the project we were working on. The management was awesome as well as the co-workers I have made life long friends. The hardest part off the job I would say was the repetitiveness but definitely not a problem. The most enjoyable part was working on a project and being recognized for your work by having your name put on the credits. I love showing my kids.",5,,
Testing Video Game,Senior Tester,Great job. Testing video games is a lot of fun. Good hours and overtime also.,4,,
Most fun an employee can have,Technical requirements tester,"This is a video game company. Do I need to say more. I went to work and played video games for 8-12 hours a day and got paid for it. Of course there was technical reasons behind that video gaming but still. This was the greatest job in the world in my eyes. However because it was an easy job to hire for, most people got fired from the company. You had to perform your job better than 99% of the people next to you or you were gone. So it had a bit of stress to it, especially as games neared completion.There was also no flexability in hours, you worked monday through friday 8am - 5pm and that was it. During crunch times you works 6 to 6.",4,"long lunch breaks, free copies of the games you worked on, play video games all day!","poor job security and advancement, high stress."
Productive and Fun Environment,Quality Assurance Tester,"Activision Publishing was my foot in the door into the gaming industry. The management and my fellow employees were such a joy to be around and although we had a lot of fun we also got a lot done in terms of testing. A typical day consisted of analyzing games prior to release and ensuring each bug was being tracked in a database for the game developer to review. I learned how to use new software, how to manage small teams during multiplayer testing, and how to identify bugs and database issues based on their severity.Although the company did not have the stability I would have hoped for, I realize this is common in the gaming industry. My time at Activision was enjoyable and they provided a fun environment as well as a comfortable break area; it's hard to frown in a room with a ping pong table.",3,"lots of opportunity for overtime, nightshift","unstable, checklists"
Nice environment,Game tester,Activision is a leading video game company and this is shown in the environment people work every day.,5,enough time to lunch and availability to take breaks from work if you are stressed.,salaries are not very high
QA Tester,Quality Assurance Tester,It's a fun job that is definitely a job.

Busy and intense studio environment,Sr. Test Lead,"If you want to jump into the trench warfare of developing for such franchises like Call of Duty, this is the place to work. Every project has a large team of dedicated individuals that find any way to get the work done within very tight deadlines. This environment requires multitasking, diplomacy, and crisis management. At Activision, or any subsidiary studio, you make miracles happen on a daily basis.",3,,
My First REAL Job,Administration Coordinator,"I consider Activision to be my first REAL job. I held several positions over my seven-year stint there, and loved each one of them.It was a demanding job, but trained me in corporate procedure, professionalism, taking responsibility for your actions...almost everything but how to walk.The whole company was, and still is amazing to me. I have stayed in touch with many of my fellow employees.The hardest part of the job was keeping all of my 'hats' straight. I filled many different needs while employed there, as I handled all employee entrance/exits; security; supply and facility management; as well as holding the position of Recreation Committee Chairperson.The most enjoyable part of my job was being on the Rec Committee, setting up events such as Ice Cream Day, buying swag for the Company Store, Birthdays, etc.",5,"great bennies, regular hours, paid parking, free games, recreation committee",n/a
"Fun place to work. Great Job, but don't seek a permanent career.",Social Media Specialist,"While working at Activision, I survived several layoffs. Your luck can only last so long. It is a fun environment and you have management who cares.The problem is that during those layoffs, the position names were changed and filled. It was really tough to move up in the organization since they did a lot of outside hiring and very little in house promoting. Many of the people who were in house and already doing the job, but not having the title were turned down for the positions due to ""lack of experience"" causing morale to dip and some employees to look for better positions elsewhere.Don't get me wrong, some people do move up, but it is few and far between for those that do.You do establish a loyalty to the company, but not because of Activision itself, but because of your co-workers. You build a brotherhood/sisterhood with them.In my experience, it is an average company. No better and no worse than any other in this day and age.",3,"free games, 1hr lunches, activision title discounts.","long term temp, standard pay for temps, but below industry standard if you are not titled."
